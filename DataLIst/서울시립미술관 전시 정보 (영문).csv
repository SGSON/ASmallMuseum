"000382","Lee Bul - Beginning","","Seoul Museum of Art","2021-03-02","2021-05-16","","","Seoul Museum of Art","","","","","Lee Bul","","<p><em>Lee Bul－Beginning&nbsp;</em>is an survey exhibition focusing on the formative years of Lee Bul’s art between 1987 and 1997 represented by archive drawings and performance documentations of the artist. This is the first solo exhibition of Lee Bul after the large scale retrospective at Hayward Gallery London in 2018 and rewinds us back in time to the past of the artist to discover where her ‘soft(fabric) sculpture’ is originated from. This first decade of her practice is a heart to understand Lee’s artistic narrative spanning through her entire career. When Lee Bul was young artist South Korean society was living through an overflow of popular culture and the sudden tide of globalization; it was a moment of historical shift when anxieties regarding the closing of the eventful 20th century collided with hopes for the approaching millennium. Within this wider context of searching for the socio-historical ground to Lee’s oeuvre the exhibition affords to survey on her early practice the exhibition introduces what happened back then inside and outside the white cube in order to re-access re-read and re-connect of unwritten history in its own contemporaneity.</p><p><br></p><p>In the mid 1980s Lee Bul as an art college student already had a strong sense of artistic identity and experimented formative development and material studies. Exploring documentations of exhibitions what Lee and her fellow artists organized and participated in we easily find the archetype of Lee Bul’s sculpture ? aesthetic symbols allegories formative expression movement of energy and rhythm fundamentals or primitive concept of Art. While continuing her art practice with “MUSEUM” members Lee on the other hand created aformal affairs along with theatrical avant-gardists and experimental musicians. They are what we call ‘performance’ today. In series of those happenings there are repetitive elements including body three dimensional costume gas mask folding fan and decaying objects. And Lee Bul among these elements becomes a medium occupying the space with improvised sounds and spontaneous movements which all happened without any scripts nor instructions. Supporting her magical imagination on ‘living sculpture’ ? a series of happenings Lee’s drawings become integral parts of the exhibition by allowing us to have a closer look on intensive narrative building. This exhibition aims at building a structural archive of all in order to experience and interpret the multi-facet context of a distinct time of her merging period referring to the raw the wild and the fast.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Exhibition Identity by mhtl 2021</p><p><br></p><p>Artwork Image from</p><p>Lee Bul <em>Artoillet II&nbsp;</em>1990 Performance Space Theater Seoul Photo: Park Hey-kyong Courtesy: Studio Lee Bul</p>","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2021%2F&FILE_NM=20210122180611_defa82d171de4c2b9c7d55fbba606eef_193ffde9d9ed4f3da20d236ccb0343af"

The mid-career artist’s 40 or so portraits of overseas Korean adoptees provide a sober look at their life trajectories as well her own. The series is presented as part of <em>The Waiting Room Project*</em> which strives to embody the diverse and heterogeneous voices of viewers. The works resonate with the history of SeMA Nam-Seoul Museum of Art (formerly the Belgian consulate) which was moved from its original location. The series also shows viewers that South Korea is the only member of the OECD that still allows overseas adoptions.</p><p><br></p><p>The title of the exhibition <em>Candid Essence*</em> expresses the disposition of someone who tries to look upon the value of human survival from the place of pure love for her fellow human beings. This phrase also reflects the artist’s own view of the adoptees as well as their ?bermensch-like will to overcome their prescribed conditions with optimism. Painted using a traditional Korean portrait technique since 2018 this series was inspired by the documentary project <em>Side by Side</em> (2018 directed by Glenn and Julie Morey)―which contains interviews with 100 overseas Korean adoptees―that the artist came across by chance. She projects her own layered identity as an immigrant mother onto the faces of adoptees whose stories she listened to with empathy. She studied and revealed the personal histories inscribed onto 50 faces. The subtitle of the exhibition <em>51 Lives</em> was named after the artist’s own life and the resilient lives of 50 interviewees in which Eastern and Western cultures clash and coexist.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><span lang='EN-US'>The exhibition’s layout&nbsp;</span><span lang='EN-US'>encourages an endless exchange between the works and viewers and constitutes a total of 50 or so paintings installation and video works. They include her <em>Ressentiment-Hyo</em> (2012) which is based on the artist’s family history <em>Music Box</em> series (2013) and finally the <em>?bermensch</em> series (2018/20) at the center. Park deepens the exploration of her own identity through various relationships such as those between couples and between herself and her parents siblings and friends. She questions the traditional concept of a family in Korean culture and shows us that we in fact do not differ much from the figures in the artist’s portraits. <em>Candid Essence: 51 Lives</em> will hopefully act as an impetus for viewers to free themselves from the social structure and mode of thinking that designate the traditional familial structure as a normal family.</span></p><p><br></p><p>* Nam-Seoul Museum of Art is a branch of SeMA which strives to become a Seoul’s network museum by specializing its branches in the city while developing the different branches simultaneously. The space acts as a process-oriented hub of relationships that embodies the diverse and heterogeneous voices of visitors. The <em>Waiting Room Project</em> primarily presents specialized exhibitions of a participatory nature and solo exhibitions of mid-career artists whose works echo the location of the former consulate.</p><p><br></p><p>* The title <em>Candid Essence</em> (or more literally “Simple Truth”) comes from the title of the 10<sup>th</sup> Film Festival for Women’s Right and the novel <em>Simple Truth</em> (Cho Haejin Minumsa 2019) a book about Korean adoptees and a woman in a military town.</p>","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2020%2F&FILE_NM=20201215155418_c1adcbfbf5384d9ebf0df55fcef40dbe_98ea403206cb42e9bdc26c0dd6890781"

For the past six years <em>Title Match</em> has experimented with exhibition formats and sought new possibilities for competition conversation and collaboration between its two invited artists. This year a theorist has been invited for the first time to change the format of the exhibition.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>In its seventh anniversary this year <em>Title Match</em> is joined by artist Yang Ah Ham and critic Dongjin Seo. The two try to converse on the theme of “How do we interpret today?” As a critical response to Yang Ah Ham's work to research and analyze problems in the social system and predict the near future Dongjin Seo brings the narrative of a Utopian past to usher in a new future. Within this conversational structure the two hope to glimpse into each other's creativity and imagination and draw out common ground on the subject in an atmosphere of respect and support.</p><p><br></p><p>The exhibition title <em>To the Wavering </em>was taken from Bertolt Brecht's poem “An den Schwankenden.” In the face of structural violence within the social system and global disasters we are all left wavering. So what can we do to bring about change in the world? What kind of relationships should we have with other members of society?</p><p><br></p><p>For 2020’s <em>Title Match</em> Yang Ah Ham and Dongjin Seo have resolved to challenge the exhibition’s model by abandoning competition and choosing cooperation. Despite the subtle differences in their stances and approaches the two refine their common position in solidarity support and trust and try to find the answer to what we should do together. And they speak to the waverers of this age.

"000378","Rise Up Rim Dong Sik","","Seoul Museum of Art","2020-08-19","2020-12-31","","","","","","","","","","<p>Rim is recognized as a nature artist in Korean art scene he has been considerably underrated and there has not been sufficient research about the artist. He has consistently pursued an art world of his own intergrating nature life and art as a persistent performer and meticulous archivist to overcome the limits of performance art.&nbsp;</p><p>The city of Seoul plans to inaugurate Art Archives Seoul Museum of Art which will become the center of the collection preservation and research of art document resources and has received a total of about 5000 pieces of resources from the artist since 2018. Thus the Seoul Museum of Art seeks to suggest a novel perspective to broaden the understanding about the artist by collaborating with Culture Headquarters Seoul Metropolitan Government and unraveling the artist’s art resources from the 1970s to 2000s in an exhibition. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The Himalayas revealed as fine dust is cleared the canals in Venice that turned brighter emerald; the recent lockdowns implemented due to Covid-19 have revealed beautiful nature around the world. Likewise is any hidden beauty overlooked in our surroundings? Not only physical things obscure perspectives. “From trembling of grass towind brushing through trees”<a href='#_ftn1' name='_ftnref1' title=''>[1]</a> things have been neglected because of human flaws such as taking for granted familiarity indifference and arrogance. The artist seeks to create a gap in the veil of human mind encountering nature and to create an airway to breathe with nature. However as in the words of the artist an act of applying breaks of 1 2 or 3 to ‘the nature of zero’ would be excessive. This is because artificial elements can play the role of another barrier. As a performer Rim creates a gap by a gesture of non-action converging to zero in order for the breath of natural being to be sensed.<a href='#_ftn2' name='_ftnref2' title=''>[2]</a></p><p>Understanding a newly categorized and registered archive in the collecting process is like putting difficult puzzle pieces together. The French historian Arlette Farge calls the archive counting unit <em>fonds</em> which means ‘ocean floor’ and describes the act of fathoming an extensive archive as being unpredictable like a natural disaster and compares it to diving submerging and even drowning<a href='#_ftn3' name='_ftnref3' title=''>[3]</a> illustrating the challenge. Fortunately conversations with the artist and the artist’s self-written texts were our trustworthy guide as he has consistently archived records of his own performances and used them as the media for new creations. Furthermore these conversations provided the joy of discovering additional archives and offered an opportunity to recognize the artist’s recent works not as a shift in artistic stance but as an extension of his performances breaking the boundaries of nature and art by using various methods on top of his unchanging tenor of praising all life out of intense love for nature.</p><p>The title <em>Rise Up</em> <em>Rim Dong Sik</em> is inspired by two performances ? <em>Stand up and Rise Up</em> ? presented at the first meeting of the outdoor field art <em>Yatoo</em> held at the Geumgang Gongju 1981. It dynamically captures the monumental moment since which Rim has walked a path of his own. The exhibition is largely divided into four themes: <em>Gesture Flow Village</em> and <em>Poetic Notion</em>. From resistance to reality and convention to performances of communion with nature and paintings that navigate between the realms of fact and imagination the exhibition is structured to allow viewers to follow the chronological flow and characteristics of works of the artist who did not conform to the dominant tendency of the time and freely express his artistic vision. The artist’s archive in this exhibition is presented as pure creations to be systematically collected categorized stored and studied as well as a cradle of significant artistic inspirations and not as records that accumulate like sediments in the deep sea. In addition the recursive summoning of the moment of artistic act that could have been forever forgotten becomes a new creative act transcending time beyond mere purpose of documentation and a product with unlimited expandability. With this type of development as the horizontal which tracks Rim’s artistic trajectory as a lifelong archivist and performer the four distinct themes of the exhibition become the verticals that intersect this together encompassing the artistic activities of Rim as a nature artist that are both overarching and individualized by period.&nbsp;</p><p>This exhibition will both be the initial step toward archive-related research and an opportunity to comprehensively witness the artistic methods of Rim an artist who has transformed the numerous processes of approaching nature ceaselessly and passionately into an art. In addition it is hoped such attempts would lead to further research about the artist who wants to be called as a ‘pondering one’ and offer opportunities for many to take interest in future projects at the&nbsp;Art Archives Seoul Museum of Art.</p><p data-empty='true'><br></p><p><a href='#_ftnref1' name='_ftn1' title=''>[1]</a> An excerpt from Yatoo Declaration by Rim Dong Sik 1981.

Famous for being home to the BBC Studios the White City area used to be where national exhibition events of the British Empire took place as well as where immigrants settled; today the city is in the middle of a rapid change due to urban redevelopment. Through interviews with the locals the artist has formatively interpreted the landscape of the city resulting in a symbolic scene of life. As the title suggests in “every second in between” time becomes a place and forms particular relationships resulting in a series of phenomena that functions as a psychological map of an imaginary character named ‘Stillman.’</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Dong Geun Lee</strong> through folding and shaping of a flat surface explores the behavioral process revealed through the two- and three-dimensionality of an object. The visuo-cognitive desires and the unique experimentation of the planar surface due to the mingling of expectations can be seen as a structural approach to painting.</p><p>His representative work the &lt;Frankie’s Lover&gt; collaboration reconstructs a previous work to add to its meaning the notion of time presented through a reshaping of a plane. Also the work condenses emotions like anticipation or fear towards movement and discovery of space and location conveyed through the experiment of a stepwise evolution of the flat surface.</p><p>Titled after a pet name of Frankenstein the work serves as a metaphor for a being of possibility in its assembly rejoining and rebirth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>STAGE 2 Fluid Clock | The Flow of Time</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Eve Kwak</strong> presents an installation work &lt;Flowerland Starland Heaven Hell&gt; notable especially for its spatial experimentation that evokes an abrupt and particular spatiotemporal experience. The title comes from a popular childhood play in which one uses the number of strokes for writing one’s name to fortune-tell the world one will be in the afterlife directly and indirectly revealed through a coalition of everyday objects. The verses from Han Seok-bong’s calligraphy (a clich? in commercial folding screens) conveys a touching sentiment of one’s remaining years communicating the notion of time through a mingling of old objects in their usage and commercial roles. Also featured are &lt;Rough Sketch 2&gt; &lt;Cloth Hanger Man 2&gt; and &lt;Just. Now. %&gt; presented as abstract form structures that create a dynamic along with the meaning derived from the textures of composite objects.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nicolas Pelzer’s&nbsp;</strong>double-channel video installation work &lt;Soul Always Return to Itself&gt; is presented in such a way as if two screens were facing each other through a mirror. In the work a 3D image industrial structure revolves in a shape similar to a human heart reminiscent of archaeological remains from the prehistoric era. Alongside are two projectors that cast shadows of each other and reveal each other’s existence on the screen functioning as a critique of the materialistic fantasy and innovative technology consumed in the modern digital era.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>STAGE 3 I Flat Staircase | The Union and Relationship of Time</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Hansaem Kim</strong> presents his new series work &lt;Whirlpool I &amp; II&gt; and &lt;Wave I ~ IV&gt; where he introduces an adventurous epic of the eternality of time. A structure that reveals an imaginary worldview of games is transformed through a peculiar relief work into a planar surface where water in a flow of water symbolizes pain that one unwantedly encounters in life. The process in which the symbolic paintings of distinct waves move in and out of the trajectory of now and eternity is introduced through pixel images and six planar paintings.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Junhyun Bae</strong> projects a critical view on utopia in his series of painting works &lt;Discoverer&gt; &lt;Explorer&gt; and &lt;Finder&gt; which are replicated and extended into large wall paintings installed along with the exhibition space. Imitating reportage the imaginary landscapes filling the exhibition space have been taken from events of social injustice and disasters reconstructed into a fictional vision that reminds us of an unspecified scene beyond our time.</p><p>At the same time the works call into question the confusion caused by the vision of utopia as presented in the media. The original pieces of work as well as their unrestrained modification and extension in form bring to attention the errors that can be produced in imaginary stimulations and fictitious fantasies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>STAGE 4 I Flora Rail | The Retrospect of Time</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Mingyu Song</strong> presents in a single landscape a scene that forms through a coalition of nighttime and daytime with space region and environment. The result is at once a landscape of forms where the phase the technique and the logic of painting are stimulated and a landscape of society where such elements meet the structure of downtown or the language of the humanities. The presented piece &lt;How Six People Look at the Moon&gt; abstractly treats the motion and time of that which exists but nonmaterially flows like a circular flight trajectory or a satellite in the night sky. The works &lt;Unfolded Moon&gt; and &lt;Black bay 9-10&gt; interpret deeper concepts of darkness and light through pure forms following the social values of colored sides.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Sueyeon Hwang</strong> presents a work consisting of theatrical paper sculptures titled &lt;Dung Fly&gt; &lt;Stupidity&gt; and &lt;Night&gt;. Each being a separate solid and yet united in space as a single collection the sculptures reveal through their completed state the process of sculpting―i.e. the history of a solid. The unique time of this process gradually morphs into a formative time of clothing a material. The properties like quantity force weight friction height all transform into moments of change and eventually the abstract structures intended by the artist―namely the simple forms of the word combined into moments of humor―leave the sculpture existing as a body put on the original material.</p><p><br></p><p style='margin-left: 20px;'>Exhibition Production: The Great Commission</p><p style='margin-left: 20px;'>Curator: Zoe Chun</p><p style='margin-left: 20px;'>Artists: Dong Geun Lee Eve Kwak Hansaem Kim Junhyun Bae Kyung Hwa Shon Mingyu Song Nicolas Pelzer Sueyeon Hwang</p><p style='margin-left: 20px;'>Performers: Da Hey Kang Gwanmok Lee Han Kim Yu Ra Jo</p><p style='margin-left: 20px;'>Acting Director: Jihee Kim&nbsp;</p><p style='margin-left: 20px;'>Music Producers: SEP Woochi&nbsp;</p><p style='margin-left: 20px;'>Lighting Designer: Ari Kim</p><p style='margin-left: 20px;'>Stage Designer: Sooran Kim (<u>OURS</u>TUDIO)</p><p style='margin-left: 20px;'>Designer: Hyeyeon Lee (Standard Document)</p><p style='margin-left: 20px;'>Photographer: Seungman Park</p><p><br></p><p><strong>The Great Commission</strong> (directed by Zoe Chun) is a non-profit contemporary art organization that facilitates the production of exhibitions performances and publications.

At the same time the images reflect on the social history structure and paradox revealed through the lives of individuals. This exhibition includes images not from those special moments that we memorialize but from the everyday moments in life. As smartphones replace cameras and as the prices of cameras fall while its technology advances photographs are no longer just a popular commodity but now a universal one. Accordingly the unique emotional value of photographs has also declined. The emergence of digital photography and the dematerialization of the medium as a result make it increasingly more difficult to define its significance today. This exhibition therefore hopes to examine those moments where photography matters again. The moments when photography makes a difference is no different from what they are. At times however we realize the value of those moments through photographs only after they have passed by. This exhibition hopes to demonstrate how photography can still make a difference in ways which we have failed to realize those moments.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style='font-size: 12px;'><br></span></p><p><span style='font-size: 12px;'>JEON SEEYOUNG <em>quarter 151-174</em> 2015-2017 Digital inkjet print Dimension variable Courtesy of the artist</span></p><p><span style='font-size: 12px;'>MASAFUMI SANAI <em>Living</em> 1995 (printed in 2020) C-print 105.5×129cm ?

A collection of various books selected from works that convey nature is available on the view in ‘Green Library’ while new-media collections in set schedule can be experienced in the comfortable space of the ‘Media Theater’. Finally the ‘Performance Stage’ presents a performance piece and a fantastic work flickering with lights is featured in the ‘Crystal Gallery’. The visitors are invited to visit the spaces in the order of their preference.<br><br></span></p><p><span style='font-family: apercu-light-pro;'>Quite a large amount of time is needed to view all six spaces. It might not be easy for the busy audience today to view the entire exhibition but we invite you to take some time out to explore the different aspects of life. This exhibition is completed by the audience when they feel understood and connected to each other through the works and when they start to feel that they want their lives to head to a better direction.

The members of these collectives might have changed or stayed the same but as in general they work by sharing opinions and discussions gathering and organizing thoughts together. Reflecting life in togetherness their works talk about technology development migration labor isolation and disasters that endlessly arise in the massive flow of capitalism and globalization.&nbsp;These works shed a serious outlook on the social problems that can happen to any one of us who happens to be born into this world of adventure and experimentation yet overlook them as if they’re some news from a remote place.</span></p><p dir='ltr'><br></p><p dir='ltr'><span style='font-family: apercu-light-pro;'><span style='font-family: apercu-light-pro;'><strong>Reference Room</strong></span><br></span></p><p dir='ltr'><span style='font-family: apercu-light-pro;'>‘Reference Room’ presents works by female artists which make up 24% of the collection at SeMA. These female artists (Suki Seokyeong Kang Koh San Keum Kim Jipyeong Shin Mee-kyoung Haegue Yang Yeesookyung Jiin You(JU JU U) Siren eun young Jung Seungean Cha and Choi Hae ri) traverse across the east and west past and present making references to music literature art drama and history in their works. These references from different places and times are summoned by female artists and interpreted in a different context as a way of deepening the understanding of the world in their works. These artists continuously ask rhetorical questions to themselves as to the social background of the references and their significance to us in this era. Their works involve the process of engaging in a conversation with these references looking at them listening to their stories retracing their meaning and expressing the artists’ own thoughts. As a result their works create a world where everyone is connected. In this space works that creatively intervene in things that already exist or cast a twisted view on the world tell the viewer about their own stories engaging with them in conversations that are at times soft while at other times chatty.</span></p><p dir='ltr'><br></p><p dir='ltr'><span style='font-family: apercu-light-pro;'><strong>Green Library</strong></span></p><p dir='ltr'><span style='font-family: apercu-light-pro;'>In the ‘Green Library’ Eco Bridge?A Rotary with 9 Piers from the collection is expanded to include various growing plants. Here artists who work with nature and everyday life (Oksun Kim Kim Ju Hyun Hyuk Jun Yi and Eun Chun) add their own sense of warm sunlight lush vegetation and fascinating narratives. Nature is an essential existence to human life. It’s a vast site where not only visible beings like humans animals and plants exist but also invisible beings form relationships and coexist. A collection of books on the subject of nature safety measures race and the female body etc is provided in collaboration with the Neutinamu Library in Yongin-si in order to offer education on ways of living with nature. The viewers are invited to sit at a warm wooden table where plants grow and think about the world in which we live and the future that we must create.</span></p><p dir='ltr'><span style='font-family: apercu-light-pro;'>&nbsp;</span></p><p dir='ltr'><span style='font-family: apercu-light-pro;'><span style='font-family: apercu-light-pro;'><strong>Media Theater</strong></span></span></p><p dir='ltr'><span style='font-family: apercu-light-pro;'>The ‘Media Theater’ presents a total of 28 new media works selected from the 224 new media works in the SeMA collection consisting of 12 single-channel videos 8 two-channel videos and 8 animation works. Screened in 3 different theaters in differently set times the works cast an insightful and witty reflections on various social problems that we face including labor virus division capitalism war dwelling and violence etc. While comfortable couches are provided for a relaxing viewing experience the content of the works are quite unsettling. In addition the works may be short in terms of duration they’re never light in terms of the subject matter and meaning. The viewers are invited to slowly view the works in the space to meditate on problems which we often overlook but are inevitably part of human life.</span></p><p dir='ltr'><br></p><p dir='ltr'><span style='font-family: apercu-light-pro;'><span style='font-family: apercu-light-pro;'><strong>Performance Stage</strong></span></span></p><p dir='ltr'><span style='font-family: apercu-light-pro;'>A video work by Sora Kim from the SeMA collection is shown on the ‘Performance Stage’. A documentation of the performance on ‘walking’ the work not only explores the gesture of ‘walking’ as an ordinary process to reach a certain purpose but also expresses the gesture and language of the act of walking itself. As we walk following a performer on the screen in the large space we reflect on things that are so ordinary that they go unnoticed and are blindly passed by.</span></p><p dir='ltr'><br></p><p dir='ltr'><span style='font-family: apercu-light-pro;'><span style='font-family: apercu-light-pro;'><strong>Crystal Gallery</strong></span></span></p><p dir='ltr'><span style='font-family: apercu-light-pro;'>Finally Yun Ai Young’s installation work made of diverse colors shapes and forms switches and light bulbs is shown in ‘Crystal Gallery’.

Celebrating the fourteenth installment of the series this year’s first exhibition invites graphic designer Na Kim. Extending beyond the realm of design Na Kim’s multifaceted practice based in Korea and abroad highlights the formal elements of graphic design through fine art.</p><p><br></p><p>The exhibition’s title <em>Bottomless Bag</em> is taken from the bag appearing in the animated film <em>Inside Out</em> (2015). Filled with the main character’s memories and their associated orbs along with an assortment of other objects the film’s imaginary bag was chosen to illustrate the exhibition’s core concepts of ‘memory’ and ‘collection.’</p><p><br></p><p>The Korean title of the exhibition references the school supply?filled ‘object bags’ sold to students in Korea during the 1980s and 1990s. Remembering this nostalgic object of the past the exhibition hopes to examine the times and memories connected by the objects.</p><p><br></p><p>In this exhibition the space itself becomes the designer’s ‘object bag’ where the images exhibited in the space become the ‘objects’ that evoke past memories and serve as the designer’s tools for a new experiment. The exhibition invites visitors to experience the meaning of those found objects collected and archived by Na Kim inside the museum space.</p><p><br></p><p>‘Collecting’ is an important part of SeMA’s agenda for 2020 as well as Na Kim’s design methodology. By setting her own rules in interpreting and creating relationships with the memories embedded in everyday objects Kim demonstrates a respectful attitude that observes and appreciates the value of everyday life.</p><p><br></p><p>With this exhibition the museum aims to generate new forms of knowledge by adopting Na Kim’s work process as an educational model and by mediating and reconfiguring it. In understanding design as a language of communication it is hoped that through Na Kim’s design-oriented thinking and visual language viewers will be able to strengthen their visual literacy which will allow them to better interpret criticize and create images.</p><p><br></p><p>Seoul Museum of Art is temporarily closed in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and ensure the safety of visitors. <em>Bottomless Bag</em> will be available for viewing when the museum reopens.</p><p><br></p><p>More details on the exhibition can be found online at the Seoul Museum of Art website at sema.seoul.go.kr.</p>","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2020%2F&FILE_NM=20200422155644_f0bbc55763e44cff82bfc916798ed52d_ae4ebe521c244d0d8cac3d296f2ae7eb"

Leandro Erlich is an internationally-exhibited contemporary artist whose work has been widely acclaimed for both its originality and popularity. His installations transform familiar everyday spaces such as an elevator staircase and swimming pool by creating optical illusions using mirrors and other various materials. &nbsp;</p><p>The artist’s current exhibition at the Buk-SeMA <em>Leandro Erlich: Both Sides Now&nbsp;</em>goes beyond examining his central theme of “perception” and further questions the relationship between the “Subject” and the “Other.” Whereas the artist’s previous exhibitions explored concepts such as “the illusion and the real” or “the imaginary and the truth” by reminding the viewers of how the world we perceive and the real are not always the same this exhibition focuses on how the “I” or the “Subject” is formed through surrounding relationships and therefore makes the boundaries between the “Subject” and the “Other” ambiguous. Those boundaries which separate two seemingly different entities remain variable according to their conditions and circumstances. There is nothing in this world whose essence or nature is invariable. Everything that consists of our world is connected and their boundaries are far from clear-cut. As shadows change according to their light source the world we perceive and those we regard as the “Other” exist as shadows created by our own perspectives.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Presented across four exhibition galleries of the museum this exhibition introduces new works <em>Car Cinema</em> and <em>In the Shadow of the Pagoda</em> two site-specific installations that dominate the space with their massive scale and ends with <em>The Cloud(South Korea North Korea)</em> a sculptural piece reflecting on the theme of the exhibition. Offering a unique viewer experience the exhibition will also present a selection of Erlich’s earlier works.

Omer Fast Jeong Su Woo Jaye Rhee Yeondoo Jung Jeamin Cha","","<p>Seoul Museum of Art's curatorial project<em>&nbsp;Compulsion to Repeat</em> or <em>Compulsion<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;</em>explores how a simple concept of 'repetition' takes shape in contemporary art highlighting the psychological obsessions that make and possess us. Various aspects of life are imbued with repetition; visible or not iteration has a stronghold over how a good portion of the world as well as physical and mental activities within it is structured. In general repetition indicates 'doing the same thing over and over again.' Yet the term is subject to negative connotations leaning more towards duplication or imitation than to the origin creation and newness. However the essential aspect of repetition since postmodernism is not subsumed under the mechanism of identity or the return to sameness. Instead it has emerged as the source of creation socially and politically reinterpreted based on the contemporary perspective that 'difference is the result of iteration.' Based on this notion this exhibition explores the 'compulsion' a psycho-pathological manifestation not as a personal concern but in terms of the social and structural matter.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><span lang='EN-US'>Compulsion indicates a 'form of repetitive behavior that is compelled by the internal urge.' This exhibition highlights the repetitive trait of compulsion while pointing to the very repetitiveness as a potential of overcoming it. In an era where the capitalist system has consumed the prospect of life <em>Compulsion to Repeat&nbsp;</em>attempts to become the testing ground of critical thinking where nine participating artists interpret and question the world around them based on the compulsive circumstances of today</span>’<span lang='EN-US'>s people represented by the pursuit of a meaningful life. From this ground of ample potential the artists set out to find an opportunity of implosion instead of looking for an innovative solution from the outside. A way out of compulsion lies not on the outside&nbsp;</span><span lang='EN-US'>?&nbsp;</span><span lang='EN-US'>violation of the norm or inauguration of alternatives&nbsp;</span><span lang='EN-US'>?&nbsp;</span><span lang='EN-US'>but on the inside. The drive to repeat oneself within the habitual compulsion or the 'compulsion of compulsion' or&nbsp;</span>“<span lang='EN-US'>compulsion x compulsion</span>”<span lang='EN-US'>&nbsp;is the strategy of artistic appropriation that runs through the exhibition. In this sense 'Compulsion<sup>2</sup>' is a singular mark that indicates how repetition is the inherent nature of compulsion. Repetition is the only move that could open up a gap within the compulsion of the era and a critical element of art as a compulsive act. Nine participating artists who repeat a piece of reality in variations with various mediums including painting video photography and sculpture reflecting the multiplicity of the world we live in. The exhibition demonstrates individual works in temporal and spatial thematic and structural repetition to experiment and explore how repetition leads to creation.&nbsp;</span></p>","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2019%2F&FILE_NM=20191204174046_ef8e0cd1d339472da05a1044878463d9_9e424599f42e4d2ab470a6286cf5cd46"

The inaugural exhibition in 2015 focused on Africa followed in 2017 by a focus on Latin America; in 2019 <em>gohyang: home&nbsp;</em>presents contemporary art from the Middle East. Considering initial impressions such as memories of several Korean corporations that developed nuclear power plant and other large-scale construction projects in the Middle East since the 1970s the complicated sociopolitical conditions of the region viewed through the perspective of news media and social prejudices and fears toward recent refugees arriving in Korea from the Middle East we may have mistakenly assumed that stereotypes formed through biased information were tantamount to actual knowledge about the Middle East region. The proposed practical tasks of this exhibition are reflecting on Arabic culture and the art it inspires both of which are still seemingly unfamiliar in Seoul and restoring a sense of place to a region that had already been lost before even existing by observing the specificity of the Arab world which has been lost before even existing by observing the specificity of the Arab world which has been abstractly expanded and perceived without any authentic knowledge.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The exhibition consists of four parts presented across two floors of Seoul Museum of Art. To begin 'Memorial Structure' deals with the specific conflict between Palestine and Israel through photographic documentary the archival image of memory multi-media installation based on private experience and questions of our perceptions and beliefs toward conditions in the Arab world. The exhibition’s second part 'What Makes Us' examines how we register collective bonds from the dimension of ritual practice understood as a measure of sentiment for a certain idealism that fulfills feelings of loss or lack evoked within the axis of grand time called history. As such this ritualistic sense of connection could be seen as 'an imagined value' constructed afterwards out of yearning for something that never existed. 'Storytelling as Silence' the exhibition’s third part presents a series of narratives by different artists that assert a contemporaneity that manifests itself as a new origin of existence. The exhibition concludes with '(un)home' dealing with the experience of something that is strangely familiar and offering the potential to go further into a hope for recovery or treatment from loss and dismay.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Art seeks for new methods of weaving together promised or unpromised time in a meaningful way. Accordingly <em>gohyang:home&nbsp;</em>introduces the diversity of artistic practices from the Middle East and Arab world encourages participation in sympathy that could be imagined from a Korean perspective and pursues clues that enable us to relate to each other. The title <em>gohyang:home&nbsp;</em>indicates the geographical sense of a hometown in Korean while expanding to a virtual world where one can overcome the feeling of loss and exclusion; it also represents an impulse to settle down vague sensibilities of nostalgia and longing and inevitably an imperfect logic.</p><p><br></p>","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2019%2F&FILE_NM=20191204164508_d02b4c289e10481d9891ef0796cdadda_6dc2cf9bc6a1434c8438726145f5fbd6"

The title of the exhibition taken from Anne? Olofsson’s work <u>Will you still love me tomorrow?</u> captures the sense of anxiety and fears in the Korean society where people are forced to look at aging through a contemporary view that pressures one to be and look young.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Globally the average human life expectancy and the proportion of the population over 60 have nearly doubled over the past few decades. In the same manner Korean is also on the verge of becoming a super-aged society with people over 65 years of age taking over 20% of the population. Despite such rapid changes in the composition of population and life cycle aging is still associated with being old and weak in the capitalist society and this is predominantly approached with an economic rather than social logic. A term that emerged in such social atmosphere is 'ageism' which defines discrimination and stereotypes based on age. Ageism amplifies oppression alienation and inequality both individually and collectively and exerts a strong influence over all generations. To make matters worse mass media reinforces the negative stereotypes about aging.</p><p><br></p><p><u>Will you still love me tomorrow?</u> is presented through three exhibition sections and public program zones aiming to examines the negative perceptions surrounding aging and to examine the influences as well as the origin of such negative perceptions on an individual and society. The first section observes aging in the context of the capitalistic social atmosphere where aging is consumed only on a superficial level through plastic surgery shopping and obsessive self-maintenance. The second section observes social problems such as conflict between generations and alienation through the different perceptions on aging by the individual and society. Lastly the third section presents works that look into the near future and invite us to think about aging in the context of one’s own narrative. In the exhibition there are also audience-participatory works that propose new perceptions regarding aging.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Based on the unique experiences perspectives and social backgrounds of the fifteen artists and artist teams in this exhibition working in fields of art design and architecture attempt to overcome the various types of discrimination in their work fueled in a society that demands the captivating capital of ‘youth’. Hopefully the exhibition stimulates new ways of looking at aging and invites us to explore innovative approaches to a longer life.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Section 1 : Anxious Desire&nbsp;</p><p>This section raises questions on the social atmosphere where beauty and ugliness are defined by whether one is young or not. Under this atmosphere aging is considered through the perspective of one’s appearance. In particular this section tries to examine how the human desire to resist the corporeal aging influences the body mind and life of individuals with regards to capitalism and consumer society. People in our time who blindly pursue the uniform sense of beauty out of fear and anxiety against aging attempt to overcome aging through a variety of obsessive self-management and consumption. In this section through images that are created from the difference and conflict between the needs and desire of people in our time aging becomes a subject of reflection that is deeper than what it seems to be on the surface.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Section 2 : Ageist myths and streotypes&nbsp;</p><p>Section 2 examines how stereotypes about aging are reinforced within social relations. Ageism justifies discrimination and alienation based on one’s age. It justifies devaluation and alienation of aged people. This section surveys the rampant ageism in the society as well as social issues that occur by the difference on the idea of aging between individuals and group under the capitalist system that escalates ageism.</p><p><br></p><p>Section 3 : The Future Not Afar</p><p>The first and second sections looked at the influence of the anxiety about aging on individuals and different aspects of how such anxiety manifests within social relations. Further the last section proposes that we shall turn the clock to the near future and imagine our own aging. With proposals for overcoming the modes of elderly living and future environments and practical works abut aging the last section provides a ground to reflect on how we should live our extended lives in a society where it is difficult to become old. Artists from different backgrounds including visual art design and architecture present their thoughts and experiments on the potential of change in our everyday life beyond anxiety and anticipation.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><u>A Project of Unboxing 21 Grams_Artist collective E.J.DOMOSO&nbsp;</u></p><p>A project to provide audiences in their 20s to 50s with the opportunity to reflect on their individual lives with the topics of “a prepared death”(well-ending) condolence and loss and possession.&nbsp;</p><p>Date &amp; Time: Sep. 6 (Fri.)

The exhibition will be held at Nam June Paik Memorial House a place for commemorating Paik’s life and art which was inaugurated in 2016 followed by its official opening in 2017. Renovated from the building standing on the site of Paik’s “House With the Large Gate” where he spent his childhood the space welcomes constant visitors with various exhibitions that present the results of explorations of Paik’s artistic practice and the reconstructions of connections that founded his artistic and philosophical grounds. This exhibition will take place in the monumental space and will propose another dimension of the performative consisting of <em>The Rock Garden</em> an archival presentation of the old house where Paik lived from the age of five to twelve and <em>Action Music</em> a presentation of the results from the workshop co-produced by local participants. The starting point of the exhibition is the ‘memories’ around Paik and takes as protagonists ‘the ones who remember’ Paik he was before he became an artist. In doing so it attempts to throw new light onto the facets of certain space and time of Paik’s childhood on which his artistic world was based as well as finding the points of connection to us here and now. <em>Action Music&nbsp;</em>in the Rock Garden will continue until February 29 2020 together with the inaugural exhibition<em>&nbsp;Tomorrow the World Will Be Beautiful.</em></p><p><br></p><p dir='ltr'>Exhibition Period: Saturday July 20 2019?Saturday February 29 2020</p><p dir='ltr'>Venue: Nam June Paik Memorial House 2-1 Jong-ro 53-gil Jongno-gu Seoul Korea (Changsin-dong)</p><p dir='ltr'>Opening Reception: Saturday July 20 2019 3 PM</p><p dir='ltr'>Global Groove&nbsp;(4 workshops): Saturday May 25?Saturday June 29 2019</p><p dir='ltr'>Television Art (3 workshops): Monday July 1?Monday August 26 2019</p><p dir='ltr'>Organized by Seoul Museum of Art</p><p dir='ltr'>In Association with Nam June Paik Family Friends of Nam June Paik and Residents of Changsin-dong</p>","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2019%2F&FILE_NM=20190821174146_f3f7ebc630524d45bd2e00153ca70a11_49c45c0e01254814be7f8d07843f06d7"

The title of the exhibition is inspired by Lee Taejoon’s novel “Planting a Flowering Tree” where the flowering tree may symbolize both modernity but also those left behind for the sake of modernity. Therefore the reality it represents may be harsh and severe but abundant and splendid at once reflecting an era that evokes both nostalgia and despair in people’s memory. Ridden with contradictions this period of modernization in Korean history still remains impossible to define even after a century yet the changes it has brought fundamentally shapes the Korean society today. Looking back on the dreams and aspirations of artists from this period this exhibition hopes to examine how their meaningful accomplishments resonate in our culture today.</p><p><br></p><p><span lang='EN-US'>1. The Birth ofthe Modern Man</span></p><p><span lang='EN-US'>Since theintroduction of modern Western culture the lives of Korean people began tochange rapidly. Modern conveniences and education not only changed thestructural aspects of society but fundamentally transformed the wayindividuals recognized their self-identity and subjectivity and reshaped therelationships between the individual and society as well as the subject andobject. Modern men and women sought to escape the traditional boundaries ofclass and family aspiring to achieve individual goals through one’s owntalents. The modern profession of being an artist became a symbol ofindependence while a new generation of women emerged as the new leaders ofmodern education. Relationships within family also changed dramatically asportrayed in the paintings of modern family openly expressing affection betweenspouses and toward their children.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p>2. Expanded Visibility</p><p><span lang='EN-US'>The educated modern man broke away from the idealism and abstract mindset of the past and instead began to closely examine the everyday life and its surrounding. This</span><span lang='EN-US'>&nbsp;</span><span lang='EN-US'>shift in intellectual thought sparked a new desire to represent reality as it is not only in the academically-trained classical style but also in a wide range of formal experimentations</span><span lang='EN-US'>&nbsp;</span><span lang='EN-US'>including the fragmentation of objects through scientific vision and composition of the picture plane</span><span lang='EN-US'>&nbsp;</span><span lang='EN-US'>according to lighting. Still life and landscape paintings of objects and nature reflect the changes in the ways of viewing the object. Still life no longer relied on conventional symbolism but focused on projecting one’s emotion onto the objects while&nbsp;</span><span lang='EN-US'>landscape paintings shifted from the idealistic scenery to everyday surrounding.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span lang='EN-US'>3. Towards Universality&nbsp;</span></p><p align='left'><span lang='EN-US'>Driven by colonialism the modernization of Korea was riddenwith contractions but nevertheless artists strived to capture the changes inpeople’s lives amidst the tumultuous times. Abstract art dominated the globalart world during this time and likewise artists in Korea delved into the trendas they aspired to create art that was universal. The last section of theexhibition examines how the movement of abstract art in Korea came to form anddevelop autonomously. Going beyond simply following the style of their Westerncounterparts artists attempted to develop a new formal expression that embodiedthe essence and tradition of Korea and based on this uniqueness maintaintheir relevance in the global contemporary art world.&nbsp;</span></p>","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2019%2F&FILE_NM=20190821145905_ae5fe78898e841b0a6b8b75d945f5024_3b7ceeabbe2d4effbcda2d8d8e6b6525"

Gimhongsok has been reinterpreting concepts and ideas that are embedded in different phenomena that occur in and around art disrupting the conventional perception of art. In the meantime SEO Hyun-Suk has been examining the meaning of theatricality and architecture by connecting different places and locations under the context of modernity.</p><p><br>For 2019 Title Match Gimhongsok presents works that reveal discomfort incurred by ‘incompleteness’ and ‘imperfection.’ The works deal with the suspicion towards ‘completeness’ ‘perfection’ and ‘order’ under the title Human Order. The project reconsiders the order and structure created through social consensus such as the conventional concepts of beauty and artwork. The artist also puts himself under self-censorship through which he discloses his own suspicion and caution towards what he has been accepting as activities that fall under different categories of art activities.</p><p><br>In Theatre of Dusts SEO Hyun-Suk invites viewers to look at the alternative reality in which Buk-Seoul Museum of Art turned into ‘ruins.’ Created in the form of virtual reality the work overviews a situation where the ideal of the avant-garde which dreamed of utopia and believed that art could change the world has been collapsed. In addition the viewers are asked to become performers of the artist’s site-specific performance and roam through the museum’s gallery and different spaces inside and outside the museum building sensing emotional stir through a variety of artistic devices staged by the artist.</p><p><br>In 2019 Title Match Gimhongsok’s ‘incompleteness’ and SEO Hyun-Suk’s ‘ruins’ are working as concepts that are employed by the artists to make candid confessions about the confusing state of being artists in the era of no absolute values and reveal a process of thought towards art activities. The ways through which the two artists create their works seem to point to disparate directions that cannot be matched under the frame of ‘title match.’ However the different elements employed by the two artists generate meanings in a certain structure. Presented together within the framework of Title Match Gimhongsok and SEO Hyun-Suk’s works build multi-dimensional collaboration.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><a class='fr-file' href='/common/fileDownload?FILE_NM=20190705101241_c2280294220444acbf8197069c557e3d_779e05c1ac11408487fd783a025a23f6&amp;FILE_ORG_NM=2019+Title+Match+SEO+Hyun-Suk+Time+Table.jpg&amp;FILE_TYPE=editor' target='_blank'>2019 Title Match SEO Hyun-Suk Time Table.jpg</a></p><p><br></p>","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2019%2F&FILE_NM=20190705100718_35910d4db6c345ea9c23ff2f23ec124e_734c052f68f449278f6f98b4579082df"

In the world of objects that we have accumulated five artists of the millennial generation ― Ahram Kwon Kim Kyoungtae Heejoon Lee Choi Goen and Hoh Woojung ― explore matters that surround them through their work. Here the objects themselves and the way the artists choose and deal with such objects are inevitably and inseparably linked to political social economic and cultural discussions.</p><p><br></p><p>With advancement in transportation information and communication national boundaries are collapsing in all areas such as finance trade scientific<s>&nbsp;</s>technology and culture and the world functions under one single system. It is a globally integrated capitalist era where the whole world operates under economic power and innovation and changes are demanded boundlessly. The ‘real’ and ‘virtual’ are intertwined in the constant stream of digital information confusing our lives even more as we strive to merely keep up with the present moment. In this age of uncertainty we often lack the means to solve problems at hand let alone predict and cope with the future. Contemplating on such issues this exhibition examines how insignificant and trivial objects reflect this age of so-called globalization and informatization and aims to bring us to a closer understanding of contemporary life and art.</p><p><br></p><p>Choi Goen (1985)’s installations of disassembled and reconstructed domestic appliances and sculptures based on computer monitor forms reflect the nature of objects in post-capitalist globalized society equipped with modern technologies and latest trends to arouse the infinite sense of lack and desires in human. Ahram Kwon (1987) sheds a critical light on the illusions and power of the digital media world through her installation works in glass a screen material used in computer monitors tablets and smart phones. Kim Kyoungtae (1983)’s IKEA furniture wrapped in marble adhesive sheets are photographed then edited to look flat referencing the way an image is produced consumed and distributed in the digital age and how reality illusion truth and fiction are blurred in the life in SNS. Heejoon Lee (1988) also appropriates the way the image is generated and presented in the digital age. His abstract paintings that edit and reconstruct landscape photographs reflect the superficial lives of people today who busily traverse across the real and the virtual worlds. Lastly the abstracted forms of diverse objects by Hoh Woojung (1987) portray anxiety in our life coming from numerous social issues as a consequence of the rapidly-changing technology and overflowing information.</p><p><br></p><p>The five artists in the exhibition unveil social issues in their everyday practice by gathering up the ordinariness of the everyday objects around them only to make them uncanny in their own way. In such age where new phenomena and problems are constantly occurring with everything changing so rapidly the interdependent relationship between the digital network and the massive mesh of globalization is inevitable. While we may not be able to revert such progress what is indeed needed at this point in time may be to stop taking daily life blindly as it is truly sense reality and be conscious and stir up changes for a better life.</p>","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2019%2F&FILE_NM=20190702170131_a982e6ff650642faa7c9eaed0cea6153_1f6ebe2c12e8447686c4c90ef513430d"

As a dancer and choreographer Eunme Ahn has continuously produced and performed new works. This year she celebrates her 30th anniversary as an artist.<br>&nbsp;<br>Then is <strong><em>Eunme Ahn_Known Future&nbsp;</em></strong>a retrospective exhibit on the past thirty years? The answer is both affirmative and negative. This exhibition is designed to be an appreciation of the contemporary artists who have collaborated with her and the active audience who have supported her as well as a celebration for the discussion on our future and its direction.<br>&nbsp;<br>Since her first individual performance as an independent artist in <strong><em>Paper Steps&nbsp;</em></strong>in February 1988 Eunme Ahn has abandoned the practice of the Korean dance industry which followed the Western style and methodology of dance and emphasized beautiful gestures and has attempted the adoption of non-dance movements. Eunme Ahn had no fear in blending the discourse of Korean traditional dance with the discourse of Western modern dance.&nbsp;</p><p>In the 1990s which includes the early days of her work in Korea and the period of her residence/activity in New York she experimented with and pioneered the dance language of postmodernism that goes beyond the phenomenological existence through themes based on social realities collaborations with artists in other genres active use of original colors and objects and stages that embody visual images. This period can be summarized as “the Koreanization of postmodernism and the postmodernization of Korean dance.”<br>&nbsp;<br>In the early 2000s during which she took office as Artistic Director of Daegu City Dance Company and produced a masterpiece she pioneered the field of Korean-style Tanztheater following the model of Pina Bausch’s “Tanztheater” which sought to restore narrativity through combining dance and play. However Eunme Ahn was not complacent about attempting and realizing the Korean-style “Vernacular Tanztheater.” &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>As a dancer who inherited the spirit of “Futei Senjin” Eunme Ahn made a great methodological leap in<strong><em>&nbsp;Let’s Go</em></strong> which was first staged at the 2004 Pina Bausch Festival. Individual elements of her choreography were specific non-dance movements which were repeated varied and constructed in order to move toward the world of abstract order once again.<br>&nbsp;<br>Since 2011 with grandmothers adolescents and adult men as her object of inquiry she experimented ? as a Korean-style response to the postdramatic theatre ? quoting and realizing their existence on stage. In <strong><em>Dancing Grandmothers</em></strong> Eunme Ahn collected the body language of people and put real people on stage juxtaposing and blending them with her choreography based on her research. The choreographer made the following comment about such change. “For the last twenty-five years of doing works for the stage I have expelled something and appealed to the world. But now I wanted to do something opposite.”<br>&nbsp;<br>Intended to be both retrospective as well as explorative of the future <strong><em>Eunme Ahn_Known Future&nbsp;</em></strong> consists of paintings installations videos sounds stage performances and archive materials based on thirty years of creative work. Nevertheless individual elements are only raw materials while the real essence lies in the audience participation that conforms to the post-white-cube museum.<br>&nbsp;<br>To put it simply the trajectory of Eunme Ahn’s works over the past thirty years becomes a stage off the stage and the gestures of everyone who visits the museum become the art. Eunme Ahn wishes that the education program of the art museum will not just be an annex to the exhibition but will itself become modern art and create the time and space for the delay of problematic judgment. She hopes that through active participation we can encourage each other to discuss and advance toward the future. Eunme Ahn argues that these activities represent “the process of giving dance back to people.” Is she hoping that through her functioning as a spirit or link a cultural project that overcomes limitations of the reality will be implemented?<br>&nbsp;<br>Seoul Museum of Art expects the audience to create a new order and disorder with Eunme Ahn and make the most of the situation for self-directed learning as they go on stage within Eunme Ahn_Known Future an exhibition more than just an exhibition. It also aims to cast light upon the artistic world she has unfolded over the last thirty years and her intended “research on the interconnections and media of reality that possess the possibility of transforming into art. &nbsp;?Chungwoo Lee (Art &amp; design Historian)</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em><span style='font-size: 24px;'><br></span></em></strong></p><p><strong><em><span style='font-size: 18px;'>&nbsp;This is Eunme Ahn</span></em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>This is Eunme Ahn&nbsp;</em></strong>is a series of performances and lectures organized by Eunme Ahn for the goal of eliciting motion within the audience.

However alongside these folk songs songs called “<strong><em>japga</em></strong>” have also existed. Whereas minyo is sung while standing <strong><em>japga&nbsp;</em></strong>is sung while sitting. While<strong><em>&nbsp;minyo</em></strong> is public-oriented japga is art-oriented. True evaluations of Gyeonggi songs and Seodo songs in the past were made through<strong><em>&nbsp;japga</em></strong>. How well a singer can sing<strong><em>&nbsp;japga&nbsp;</em></strong>was an important factor in the assessment of his/her competence as a singer.

All together 95 artists.","","<p>The museum’s permanent collection and its present status at the Seoul Museum of Art</p><p><br></p><p>In 2019 works in the permanent collection of the Seoul Museum of Art (SeMA) totaled 4913 in number. Starting with its very first collection '<em>Korean Residents in Japan(4)</em>' (1985) by Park Saeng-gwang collected in early 1985 the museum currently has approximately 5000 works in its collection. This yearly introduction of new acquisitions in the form of an exhibition demonstrates what collection means to a museum and '<em>Multi-Access 4913'</em> is an attempt to present the overall nature of the museum collection on top of its new acquisitions. Just as newness is generated through history it’s essential to look at the present state of new acquisitions by ruminating on the past and analyzing the collection’s existing works in order to explore the history of the collection in the future.</p><p><br></p><p>In 2018 SeMA acquired 162 works (139 purchased and 23 donated). '<em>Multi-Access 4913'</em> regards the storage of the museum where the collected works are kept as a mechanism of storage and is organized to access that medium from multiple angles through the archive exhibition and screenings. '<em>Multi-Access 4913'</em> takes off from the conventional notion of a new acquisitions exhibition as a routine annual display of the museum’s new collected works. Rather its purpose lies not only in presenting the newly collected works but also in the general organization of the collection to function as a mechanism of the museum’s history and memory as well as in the expansion of the ways through which to ‘access’ the collection.</p><p><br></p><p>First the archive room which shows the overall nature of the museum collection holds materials that categorize history by the period/genre of the work as well as its year of acquisition and year of production. This space functions as the background on which speculations on the history of acquisitions to come take place and the future plan is drawn. In addition it becomes a site where the relationships between the newly acquired works and the existing works in the collection are formed. For reference the standards for classifying the genre of the archive material is based on the ‘work category (Korean painting Painting Drawing &amp; Print Media Photography Design Calligraphy Sculpture Installation New Media Craft)’ according to the ‘Seoul Museum of Art Collection Organizing System’.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>In particular the ‘Design’ category was first created in the museum in 2017 with the receiving of a work donated by Ahn Sang-soo but has become exempt from the genre category due to the lack of sufficient data for analyzing the age. ‘Calligraphy’ and ‘Craft’ are genres established through the museum’s acquisition of most of the works that were exhibited in '<em>Seoul Craft Exhibition'</em> (1991-2000) and <em>'Seoul Calligraphy Exhibition'</em> (1993-2000) for the stable operation of the museum. However the two categories do not demonstrate a historical continuity and are thus difficult to be analyzed based on linear history; therefore the two categories were not included in this project.</p><p><br></p><p>The exhibition and screenings introducing the new acquisitions from 2018 reject art historical style and thematic composition; instead the works are presented as a symbol installed in the order of organizing number or the unique code given to the work when it was brought into the museum storage. Such a method seemed suitable for an exhibition introducing a large number of the collection’s works in the sense that it allows the audience to browse through the works in a more liberal way without being pressured to understand the theme of the exhibition.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><em>'Multi-Access 4913'</em> reflects on the museum’s collection which went through a continuous process of self-redefinition in SeMA’s efforts to establish its identity from its periods of experimentation and exploration to expanding its practice through exhibition planning and implementation of educational programs. Just as the museum must continue to ask what role it must play in order to continue to exist this exhibition explores such questions by presenting screenings of new acquisitions based on the organization of the existing collections. Tracing back on the history of the museum and writing the history of the new acquisitions are fundamental processes in demonstrating how “an outstanding collection provides the framework for all exhibitions through which the establishment of the museum is formed and changed.” By calling forth the museum’s collection '<em>Multi-Access 4913'</em> is a new endeavor to write the history of tomorrow together.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Seolhui Lee (Curator Seoul Museum of Art)<br></p>","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2019%2F&FILE_NM=20190424180317_cc0a2cea80fb46cd8f31f3405da949b8_d29dd961030c42649bf545498f614943"

He has been consistently innovative and adventurous in questioning how we look at the world and depict it in two dimensions and has demonstrated a range of possibilities in his work not only within the traditional areas of painting printmaking and drawing but his more recent use of photography and digital technologies.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Spanning his career from the mid 1950s to the present this is Hockney’s first survey exhibition in South Korea.

With the emergence of the internet the 1990s and the 2000s marked an era when artists actively began to explore the roles and rules as well as the possibilities and limitations of the new medium. WEB-RETRO aims to revisit this period and reexamine how artistic practices have been transformed by the internet over the years. Considering the unique characteristics of internet art the exhibition explores the medium in three aspects ? “How did internet art look at the society and engage itself with it?” “How did internet art reflect the cognitive changes in the meaning of individual existence and image?” “How did internet art expand the boundaries of art in its time?”&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>In response to these questions the exhibition introduces the following categories of artworks. The first is a group of works which utilized cyberspace as an alternative space for expression and a strategic media outlet by way of social intervention or critical response against the society by revealing its hidden aspects. The second category looks at artistic experiments that redefined conventional artistic medium and explored new realms of expression made possible by technologies such as screen images virtual reality real-time remote control and etc. The third group represents those works which embraced the open environment of the internet where anyone could become a creator and where underground cultures and active communication flourished in both commercial and public realms.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>In addition to the artworks WEB-RETRO presents an online archive project which links important historical works of internet art on the website as well as an offline archive which traces important chronologies and events in the technological social and cultural developments of the genre. Moreover the exhibition includes a special restoration project for those artworks that could no longer be exhibited due to their outmoded technology. Collectively the archive projects aim to introduce the wide range of artistic attempts in internet art from both the Korean and international art world and construct a comprehensive topography of their historical cultural and technological context. By providing such long-term broad perspective of the genre the archives hope to build a foundation for further in-depth art historical research by identifying the critical periods and characteristics of the genre.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>WEB-RETRO not only hopes to provide an important starting point for art historical research on internet art that is yet to be established in Korean contemporary art but also to <span lang='EN-US'>address the issues of its conservation and collection and to provide an opportunity to deeply contemplate the potential possibilities of post-internet art today.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2019%2F&FILE_NM=20190322141405_d959462e26034b058fa6d2db44a1761e_6bf993ada8154185962c0038a81910c9"

Everyyear Seoul Focus selects a central theme which reflects the current trend of contemporary art and expands on the museum’s identity as a community?oriented institution. This year’s exhibition examines the disruption of the global ecosystem and human life explored through the language of art.</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Capitalism’s endless pursuit of profit and short?sighted drive for growth are not only creating fissures in the global ecosystem but also threaten the survival of many of the planet’s species including humans. The air and water we breathe and drink are already contaminated with fine particles while abnormal weather conditions have become the new normal. These symptoms of catastrophe clearly indicate that the planet has surpassed the limits of its capability for self?recovery. The development of technology and globalization driven by mankind has aggravated this disaster to epic proportions that go beyond national borders and continents. The likelihood of a major catastrophe which is rapidly increasing has already become our reality. Today as we enter a new geological era defined by the global ecological changes brought on by humans this exhibition questions how we will face this catastrophe of our time and what we must do to ensure survival for all species.</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; This exhibition examines a diverse range of aesthetic attempts which seek to bring about change to the current global ecological crisis and introduces them in three different layers. The first includes artworks that contemplate diverse perspectives and modes of thought on that which has been consumed and wasted in today’s neoliberalist society. The second examines artistic practices and attitudes toward life that escape anthropocentric thinking and seek different ways for all species to coexist on Earth. Lastly the third layer imagines a new type of community in which people unite and maintain free?form relationships to address and resolve issues in order to bring about change amidst crisis. It is ultimately where these three layers overlap with one another that we can glimpse into the possibilities of simple yet significant approaches to sustainable life. Here we can also witness the playful and festive vision of the Millennials which sets them apart from the public campaigns of previous generations.</p><p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; 2019 Seoul Focus begins with the issues of waste management which started to gain much public attention last year and aims to widen the scope of this discussion to examine the current ecological crisis as well as the consumerism and capitalism that underlie all of these issues. The title of the exhibition <em>Nothing Twice</em> is inspired by the Polish poet Wisława Szymborska’s poem of the same name which contemplates the fleeting meaning of life and existence through the individual stars that glimmer across the dark sky every night. Through such introspection on the finite nature and preciousness of life this exhibition hopes to build a foundation for our efforts in restoring the damaged global ecosystem and to provide an opportunity to address the crisis of our time while contemplating the possibilities for peaceful coexistence between humanity and the planet.</p>","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2019%2F&FILE_NM=20190328151906_91aa4c86e52a4afaa693c111b3055501_c39356d1794b41e3bb839e72f348b584"

Han was born in Seoul studied Western painting in Manchuria and Japan. After Han quit the position as an art professor he moved to Paris France in 1961 to pursue his experimental spirit and unique independent practice.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style='font-family: 함초롬바탕;'>Han devoted his life to the creation of unique figurative language introspecting space-times and the root of life on the base of ideas derived from Eastern and Western philosophies. His painting is characterized by an exquisite fusion of brilliant primary colors and meticulous geometrical composition. He captured the infinite circulation of the cosmic energy in his canvas and constructed the futuristic space boundlessly expanding and resonating out of the plane-surface. Such work reflects the manifestation of the artistic view which seeks to express the truth of the invisible order and vitality behind phenomena through fine art elements of the color line and form.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style='font-family: 함초롬바탕;'>This first posthumous exhibition of Han attempts to shed light on the artist’s overall accomplishments of his artistic oeuvre and take a closer look at the essence of the artist’s pursuits. The exhibition is geographically classified into two periods Seoul and Paris and highlights changes of the artist’s oeuvre starting with his figurative works from the 1950s to works that integrate space-times and dynamic geometric abstraction from the 1990s. In particular the exhibition will examine the pure abstract work of the 1960s and print works of the 1970s which became the basis of his geometric abstract works later on. The paper collages and works using paper brush and ink which Han continued to produce after the 1980s are interpreted as a transformed aspect of the artist’s later works. The drawings from the 1960s to 1990s being introduced for the first time in Korea also present a wider understanding of the artist’s art world. This exhibition offers a valuable opportunity through which to explore the spiritual world and artistic accomplishments which Han tried to reach.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2018%2F&FILE_NM=20181213181935_919c233d7af14cc18cc48cbcaefd5412_0f073d357e5c4f0faa71fe87092a3bed"

As a result of such phenomenon it is becoming increasingly difficult for us to communicate and understand each other to escape the traps of commodification and to identify facts and truth from the rest.&nbsp;</p><p>In this context the exhibition probes the issues on three different levels. First it reflects on the conditions of our society and the systems of communication to examine how the so-called “news” are being fabricated and distributed. More specifically this section of the exhibition reveals both the desire and crisis of the Korean society through works that appropriate the content and format of news broadcasting as well as the online comment culture. Exploring images and contents that <span lang='EN-US'>clash and collide with one another the works portray the dark reality of how such fabricated contents are consumed in our society today.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang='EN-US'>Second the exhibition broadly examines how the images are created distributed and ultimately alter our senses in the current media and communication environment. The works in this section demonstrate how the human desire to be recognized by others feeds into the bubble of social media and personal broadcasting. At the same time they question whether images created by AI and other algorithms are in fact designed to reinforce agendas and prejudices advocated by certain groups. Some of the works in this section also reveal a spectacle of images filtered through our online and media setting appropriated by artists in the form of paintings and prints.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang='EN-US'>Lastly the exhibition looks into experiments on new ways of communication and the possibilities they present in the current age of post-truth. This section includes artworks which probe the issues such as human rights and the environment that arise from global political and military conflicts. They investigate the issues by incorporating methods of scientific research or reconstructing them in panoramic imagery. In both cases the works collectively explore the boundaries of contemporary art and journalism to engage with the issues of our reality and to broaden the scope of our judgment. More importantly they attempt to create social dialogue and inspire change.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang='EN-US'>In the sea of information that blinds us today we must go back to the fundamental questions in order to communicate understand each other and to distinguish the facts and truth. We must ask ourselves how and what we will speak for. This exhibition hopes to provide an opportunity for the viewers to be inspired by the questions raised by the artworks and to open our eyes to a new horizon beyond the wall that surrounds us.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2019%2F&FILE_NM=20190104125514_55bad5b1a2384c258c6bf2674a2bd68c_e534777d58904a92b330c4c388c11bc0"

This edition’s biennale theme is “Eu Z?n” a greek language which means a “good life.” The biennale includes not only intellectuals from a broad range of fields such as art economy environment politics society and technology but also aims for an exhibition that is open to the general public. In its attempt to maximize people’s access to culture and art it aims to provide opportunities for a new social shift.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good Life” has been the most crucial point of reference for humankind in establishing its being. The specific content of a good life differs according to elements such as time space and culture. Yet on the other hand in those countless variations of the form of a good life there are certainly common denominators to be found. Eudanomia or in other words the flourishing life that develops through awakening the desires and abilities dormant in the human body and mind could be named as the first denominator. The second common denominator is the fact that exploration based on endless discussions is necessary to grasp what a good life means to an individual.</p><p><br></p><p>Seoul Mediacity Biennale 2018 aims to explore and discuss with the multitude what this notion of a “good life” and to identify creative and future-oriented alternative values that are “Noch Nicht (Not yet) but already noticeable. Biennale participants are not confined to contemporary visual artists but include ”new practitioners“ such as activists planners researchers who demonstrate creative forth in different fields of life. The space Agora is installed in the middle of the museum’s 1st floor as a place where the public and the private matters intersect and people can discuss ”good life“ which is a political and public issue as well as an individual and private question at the same time. Through the whole Biennale a great number of lectures talks performances will be presented centered around Agora.</p><p><br></p><p><img src='/common/imageView?FILE_NM=20180908102212_89bee4f5af8942bb8da6faf3946ed673_25db6d83a1cb4fdab4204ae4cc176d9d&amp;FILE_TYPE=editor' style='width: 800px;' class='fr-fil fr-dib fr-draggable' data-name='programm_spread_cover12.jpg'></p><p>&lt;Agora as Medium&gt; - Namsoo Kim (Member of Directorial Collective)</p><p>From the very beginning until its 10th edition the Seoul Media City Biennale has focused on creative relationship-building between media and art. While this relationship building remained a consistent theme throughout changes that were by no means insignificant were wrought upon the exhibition concepts depending on the weight of these relationships. While the focus was accompanied by the larger trend of media art in the early- and mid-stages of the Biennale more recently the emphasis has been on feeling out the fundamental possibilities of the medium itself.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Which is why in this year’s Biennale the significance of the medium itself will once again be explored under the ethos and concept “Eu Zen” with the installation of a space and production of programs Agora within the exhibition gallery of the Seoul Museum of Art (SeMA). This space will host lectures conversations discussions and performances that will bring together the mythos pathos and logos of “Eu Zen.” Learning to live well―to learn well act well and play well―will be the thrust of Agora where the meaning of the medium will be brought to reality.</p><p>&nbsp;While medium as a concept was featured previously in the 2014 Biennale as its third definition the “psychic and shaman medium” that connects us to the other worlds this Biennale edition will imagine the medium in the first meaning of the word i.e. the empty space between several worlds. In this empty space law and order are laid down according to the authority of the space itself that existed before any action or intervention by humans. Agora will contain the principles of this law and order and will function as an empty space where we can learn to live well. While this represents a rather substantial leap from the typical meaning of media art the aim here is to rein in the concept of medium to a familiar and (in fact) refreshing territory in keeping with the spirit of “being mindful of where you’re standing in.”</p><p><br></p><p><img src='/common/imageView?FILE_NM=20180908102309_79794b017e214b969ac9535ffdfb9af5_8bbaeba069214c8db6ba98d18db7ec14&amp;FILE_TYPE=editor' style='width: 800px;' class='fr-fil fr-dib fr-draggable' data-name='programme_single5.jpg'></p><p><br></p><p><img src='/common/imageView?FILE_NM=20180908102329_25a90499a85d44708adc0678f118495b_425d966fdb794f9dbaa3ed10a7e187d7&amp;FILE_TYPE=editor' style='width: 800px;' class='fr-fil fr-dib fr-draggable' data-name='programme_single6.jpg'></p><p><img src='/common/imageView?FILE_NM=20180908102340_fa2f4c58abc24e3f91ddf62b778b68bc_3aa8e934ea9440e18e3c58af45028a7f&amp;FILE_TYPE=editor' style='width: 800px;' class='fr-fil fr-dib fr-draggable' data-name='programme_single7.jpg'><img src='/common/imageView?FILE_NM=20180908102349_009caa9b427245e9a3557f4c0f5a1355_a31e57ac37264e2b8ed766d289deb793&amp;FILE_TYPE=editor' style='width: 800px;' class='fr-fil fr-dib fr-draggable' data-name='programme_single8.jpg'></p>","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2018%2F&FILE_NM=20180905104525_04202c1a1a174cef9e855332f8895f62_918bb37a23024c459290bc6fe705da85"

With the collapse of the rationalist worldview that was long at the heart of Western thought the human body has reemerged as an important subject matter for artists today more than ever before providing them an endless source of inspiration and creativity. Such a change derives from the realization that no matter how desperately we as humans try to reach the absolute and transcend our own existence here and now we are ultimately physical and organic beings.</span></p><p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;font-size:13px;font-family:&quot;맑은 고딕&quot;;'><span style='color: rgb(0 0 0);'>In the manner of a pseudo-scientist artist Hyungkoo Lee analyzes deconstructs and reconstructs the human body. Lee experiments with enlarging human body parts using his devices and contraptions and expanding our sense and perception through media. Through his works the artist reveals the incredible ability of the human body to adopt and systematically function in its given environment. In this exhibition Lee introduces his new work <em>Kiamkoysek</em> which further expands on the artist’s concepts of the human body. Enveloping the viewer with its vast landscape-like scenery the large-scale work reveals the anagogic relationship between man and universe by transforming images of human bones into a landscape of oddly-shaped rocks (<em>Kiamkoysek</em>) that embody the laws of nature.</span></p><p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;font-size:13px;font-family:&quot;맑은 고딕&quot;;'><span style='color: rgb(0 0 0);'>Artist Min Oh creates works that analyze and deconstruct musical structures through the eyes of a performer or those that examine the physical sensations and conditions of performers on stage. In this exhibition Oh examines the sensations and reactions internalized in the performers’ bodies during training to achieve the moment of perfect control while also focusing on their body language caught between repetition and difference familiarity and unfamiliarity when they are put under unstable circumstances beyond their control. Oh’s three new works for this exhibition center on an ?tude composition which requires specific techniques to master. The works connect to Oh’s earlier works on the theme of performance as mastering the ?tude in turn leads to the beginning of mastering another piece that requires the same techniques. Through her works Oh probes into the process of endless practice that is repeated until the performers would unconsciously react to every movement and sound in their own heads then recalls those moments into the present of here and now.&nbsp;</span></p><p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;font-size:13px;font-family:&quot;맑은 고딕&quot;;'><span style='color: rgb(0 0 0);'>Presenting the works of Hyungkoo Lee and Min Oh together in the format of a title match the exhibition highlights the artists’ unique attitudes and methods of analyzing and deconstructing the objects revealed in the process of production then reconstructing them according to their own rules.

At the same time the viewers will be able to appreciate the exceptional formal beauty of their works which goes beyond any comparison between the two artists.

The title “Corner Dialogue” is an expression that integrates his artistic practice and attitude where he departs from one point by reading a specific space and gradually makes a three-dimensional figure. The show is completed in the intersection of his thinking process on spacetime with the movements of the audience. Centered in the Project Gallery on the third floor including the sunlit corridors the space in front of the lift on the second floor with its many users and the upper reaches of the lobby space the exhibition extends outward to all parts of the museum.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Jong Oh is an artist who travels between many cities and countries with his tools and materials in a backpack trying to create things along the way. The gallery is to him both a space for shows as well as a studio. His works flexible while responding to the space with a mathematical approach always result in experience. Accordingly his practice is defined as site-specific installation or spatial drawing/installation rather than traditional sculpture. Taking the space itself as a material the artist creates harmony and tension with understatement and maximizes expression. Unlike other exhibitions filled with artworks or objects he primarily uses materials like thin lines creating a non-physical space. Our gaze and senses are turned into something we haven’t recognized.</p><p><br></p><p>For this spatial project the artist presents one of his representative works Room Drawing. At the beginning of the <u>Room Drawing&nbsp;</u>series he made works by erasing flaws found in the process of bringing or simplifying places or landscapes to the gallery space. Over time he has developed the incorporation of the gallery space as a part of Room Drawing by taking these traces as a starting point for his work or realizing the installation using particular forms of the space as raw materials. <u>Room Drawing (graduation) #1</u> is the result of dialogues that took place between the artist and the space at a certain time using the architectural elements of the museum the interior and exterior structures of the gallery space and features of the environment. Having worked to break down the boundary between material and tool for this exhibition the artist makes a work of art out of a “folding ruler” an essential tool for making works. Using this tool he will measure architecturally interesting points such as windows stairs and corners of the museum and turn these into forms to be installed inside and outside of the gallery space.</p><p><br></p><p>In this way with the movements of their bodies the audience experience a space which is the outcome of the artist’s imaginative reinterpretation. Jong Oh invokes new unconsciousness perception and a sense of the space that surround us. The movement of the audience which is an essential part of the works creates another meaning among the gallery space the works and ourselves. The artist who shows the spaces of the museum as the medium as well as the finished outcome provides a maximized spatiotemporal experience and ultimately challenges our recognition with respect to perceiving and seeing art.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>* The exhibition title “Corner Dialogue” comes from the book<em>&nbsp;</em>Float series 7(Hezuk Press 2017) which documents the dialogue of the artist with the A4 size paper.</p>","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2018%2F&FILE_NM=20180626094416_289c2d0c2e744bde8927b6dbe0f075fc_3e737ec83c934a1691004caed243bb75"

Deviating from the previous economical model of urban development people shed new light on the value of aesthetic design in the public realm and people’s everyday life.

This exhibition is designed to establish the bunker’s discriminative identity and serve as an opportunity for viewers to have new experiences with art by intentionally dismissing any historical approach to deem such a bunker as a vestige of dictatorship or the scars of war. Ever since the bunker was founded in 2005 when the Seoul Metropolitan Government began construction on the Yeouido Bus Transfer Center the general public has accepted the universal concept of a bunker due to several policies based on our preexisting notions and assumptions. This exhibition however focuses primarily on the existential concept of a bunker and intends to shed light on the SeMA Bunker as an underground utopia.  The Seoul Museum of Art views the bunker from an interdisciplinary perspective that integrates architecture archeology literature environmental planning studies and psychology in order to establish its own ultimate ontology keeping its traits pertinent to only the “underground.” Excavating a Neanderthal’s fossils or the remains of ancient Troy serves as an opportunity for us to interpret the act of digging in the ground as an epitome of cerebral explorations thereby associating the underground with the discovery of truth. We normally bury all causes and effects in the earth when foot-and-mouth disease and the bird flu virus sweep the nation since such endeavors provide us with emotional stability. Underground structures are considered a preferred solution to destroying the ecosystem and the current environmental issues we face by virtue of this.   The ground for this is Gjøvik Olympic Cavern Hall an ice hockey rink built underground for the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer Norway. The emergence of similar underground buildings has positively contributed to the advancement of the construction industry and has been interpreted as a new resource of the material world gaining legitimacy in terms of modern consciousness. The bunker regarded as a secret space for only those who are chosen comes into being with such a constructive background.  A bunker is usually interpreted as either a logistics base or a means for military operations. The SeMA Bunker however is differentiated from this definition. As the bunker located at the Yeouido Bus Transfer Center turned into a base to enjoy culture and art in 2017 it brought down those who were not considered when it was designed and refurbished. This point raises discourse on the new underground world the SeMA Bunker may have forged. This has the bunker work as a “superspace” through an overturn of each observer’s eyes while pushing beings and notions that are not involved with each other into an underground architecture. The audience isolated there will build their own utopia through their own dialectical thinking facing a wide array of works.   The title Instruction for the Audience is derived from Instruction for the Public Behavioral Strategies that guide viewers how to act in case of fire at the SeMA Bunker. It conveys paradoxical implications that the exhibition has to separate people who must follow the manualized evacuation method from the viewers who have to attain its completion as well as it introduced behavioral strategies for viewers to have new experiences while following presented coordinates. The exhibition declares an extraordinary artistic approach to take one step closer to our history and society. It is our expectation that the exhibition will serve as an opportunity for all visitors to the SeMA Bunker to gain their own artistic idioms.

Lee recalls his support for realist works was out of “a sense of responsibility as someone who was in the art scene at the time through the mid-80s” indicating a sense of regret about those times that is vividly on display in these 200 pieces by 46 artists who struggled through Korea’s turbulent modern history. The collection includes 160 pieces by artists who actively led the Minjung Art movement (minjung-“the people”) which are appreciated as works that most intensely represent the spirit of those times.</p><p><br></p><p>With Seoul’s confirmation as host city of the 1988 Olympics and 1986 Asian Games in the early 1980s the Korean Fifth Republic spurred development by focusing the energies of the entire nation on industrialization and urbanization. The so-called “3S” policy which encouraged screens sports and sex led to transforming everyday life and making it more colorful and glamorous than ever. However the implementation of the appeasement policy was intended to distract the public from the lives and voices of the masses who suffered from inequality between the cities and the countryside the harsh reality of national division and unfair labor conditions diverting the national desire for democratization into disinterest in politics.</p><p><br></p><p>In the midst of these historical currents a voice of self-examination burst from inside the art scene on the persistent silence of modernist art about the ongoing situation thus giving birth to Minjung Art. Young artists and art critics who were then in their 20s or 30s formed small groups and issued statements calling for the revival of figurative painting that reflected reality with a critical eye. The artists who took part in this exhibition led this Korean art movement which had sprung up spontaneously. In particular a section at the center of the exhibition space will introduce artworks aimed at soothing a wounded society through collective sinmyeong in order to overcome reality. They achieved the unique aesthetic of Minjung Art by working out the pains of their time through collective sinmyeong or mass excitation which is felt when staging energizing shaman rites engaging in traditional folk dance and participating vigorously in Korean folk performance groups. Sinmyeong also meaning an energetic state in which one can easily overcome any obstacles was also seen in artworks and hanging paintings (geolgae geurim) from the mid- to late 1980s when the appeasement policy was lifted and the struggle for democratization was extremely heated thus driving the unfolding of a new chapter in Minjung Art. A 14-meter-wide hanging picture “Story of the Painting Scene in the 80s” is the result of a collaborative effort by artists providing an opportunity to appreciate the greatest masterpieces of Minjung Art from the 1980s in a single glance. This permanent exhibition featuring the GanaArt Collection one of the principal collections of the Seoul Museum of Art should provide viewers insight into the Zeitgeist of the time and into Minjung Art which was at the forefront in the transition of Korean modern art history from multiple perspectives.</p>","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2018%2F&FILE_NM=20180816134116_5e0463c7daa3419189addbfc374e5356_544cbf36e051480c9196ca4918349116"

The purpose of the exhibition is to open the museum collection to the public and provide the audience with a platform for reading trends in art historical research and contemporary art. For this exhibition the museum analyzes the existing collection and enhances areas which are deemed insufficiently valued in terms of art history and genre and annually purchases works worthy of contemporary value. Currently the Seoul Museum of Art holds about 4700 works of art in its collection of which 188 were collected last year.  This exhibition of new collections is distinctly different from special exhibitions in which works are selected based on an established subject or concept. What is essential in constructing a certain form or composition of an exhibition of this personality is to re-read and categorize history through the acquired works. Through this process what is witnessed is how works of various subjects and diverse forms coexist not in a singular landscape but in the intersections of multiple paradigms.  With such intent the exhibition Heaven Earth & Man introduces new works collected by SeMA in 2017. The title of the exhibition was borrowed from the video installation work Heaven Earth &Man & #40;1990& #41; by Oh Kyung-hwa which analyzes life in Korea from the historical political social and natural perspective and captures artists confronted with such life. The title was appropriated to embrace the idea that the present state of art within the structure that surrounds us will always encompass constant variations in the countless correlations today as it has always done in the past.  The exhibition contemplates on three big themes ― Heaven Earth Man ― through 70 works of art in Korean painting western painting drawing print media photography sculpture installation new media and craft. The works on the 2nd floor focus on the natural landscape inside and outside art while the collection on the 3rd floor echoes with the resonance of the age derived from history. While each frame demonstrates a specific aspect they will also create a whole picture of contemporary art by relating to each other.  As an index of history and the present status of the art museum the museum collection establishes its own identity. To this end the annual exhibition of SeMA’s new collection proposes to facilitate the public understanding of the museum’s collection and hopes to read today through the rumination of yesterday. The collection of the museum is shown in various special exhibitions besides the new collection exhibition and are also presented in foreign collaboration exhibitions with the City of Seoul as well as in the SeMA collection lounge set up by organizations affiliated with the City of Seoul.  The collection of a museum is an invaluable material for faithfully identifying both a continuing history as well as the contemporary art scene. It’s also a keyword that suggests a vision for a future which has yet to arrive.

Still all work related to embroidery weaving knitting and ‘thread’ was deemed as women’s work. In modern times such a social perception was overthrown and as embroidery and knitting began to be positively used as methods of healing or resistance against the existing structure of a society its value has been reevaluated within the field of art.   In the meantime the handiwork of women who worked with thread and textiles played a crucial role in industrial field. However pertaining to economic significance such handiwork was dismissed as subsidiary labor or leisure activity. In recent times the value of handmade goods has once again been placed in the spotlight. A lifestyle enveloped in handiwork has been illuminated and a movement to re-position the fundamental value of labor in such a lifestyle is in progress.   The exhibition with weft with warp will take needlework embroidery weaving and knitting to approach visitors with strategic creative methods or themes. Simultaneously the exhibition will be composed of works exploring women and society and this will form the base for a project that discovers the value of the future led by communities. This will shed light on artistic social activities that will break through existing boundaries such as those that exist between art and everyday life craftsmen and artists and professionals and amateurs.   Just as weaving is completed only when the weft and warp come together in harmony this exhibition will be a valuable time to reflect on the balanced value of life and the social role of art.

The exhibition is not only retrospective on Ahn’s unique and varied design practice from the ahn sang-soo font released in 1985 up to the letter works of present date but also respectfully connecting his design philosophy weaved by varied activities including design publications organizing cultural initiatives and the commitment to education through the Paju Typography Institute & #40;PaTI& #41; which Ahn has opened 6 years ago in the book city of Paju together with numbers of younger designers and educators in Korea.  Entitled as salm.letters [活字] this exhibition explores the works done by designer Ahn Sang-soo centered on letters. Ahn Sang-soo as a representative designer in Korea has always worked on creating and practicing around letters. To him letters are “living organisms” or “living things” just like the Chinese character 活 refers to. He believes that all the creations with letters such as a book as a bind of letters exist together in the net of a living universe hold by vast amount of knowledge and signs. The receiving procedure itself is however like “infusing life into a lifeless thing”. Ahn’s anguish and impulse as an artist however is probably approaching the transcendental sense of letters as pure images and experiments as they provide the ultimate resonance beyond the meaning.   This exhibition especially emphasizes East Asian letter culture as a key issue to bound the region closer with the spirit of harmony and inter-connection. The cultures of East Asia including Korea China Taiwan and Japan are tied by the common character we refer to as “Chinese letters” but of course today the true nature of the letter culture bears a different status in each country. Chinese letters among others which is located in the east of the Eurasian Continent are based on a multi-level structure that has roots in hieroglyphic features. Therefore they belong to a complicated semiotic system which does not fix the matrix. While simple Romanized alphabet type led to the creation of the Internet era Chinese and Korean alphabets are still questioning on their suitability to internet settings specifically within the issue of economical efficiency. The commissioned work Tao de Ching tiles suggest us the future to typography and design in East Asian culture from the aspect of character systems and the most profound philosophy commonly shared in East Asian region. Ahn’s letters are probably searching for one undivided truth at the root of all things just like what Taoism teaches us.    While Chinese belongs to “an isolating language” of a single morpheme system Korean consists of polysyllables and belongs to the Ural Altaic “agglutinative language & #40;characterized by application of postposition or change of affixes& #41;”. At the same time Korean is very complex composed of about 1000 syllables because the basic principle of “speaking” made the shape of the Hangul letters. In Room 1 at the White Gallery of Xue Xue there are two different versions of Tao de Ching composed in two different language; Chinese and Korean and they provide us a chance to face to the “difference” of these two languages. The concept of ‘difference’ itself is the core spirit of Korean language Hangul when it was first created to be different than the Chinese domination in East Asian region of the time. The ‘difference’ has been also the indication for Ahn in his design philosophy as well as it also provokes a similar way of creating symbols or logos; that we try to arrange it in a simple form to make it as functional & #40;readable& #41; as possible but at the same time searching for the “redundancy” that might be connected with beauty richer communication and ultimate resonance.	  Departing from this living element within letters that is containing the source of life the exhibition also explores Ahn’s past creations and activities. From opening the first internet cafe in Korea with his lifelong friend and sculptor gum nuri to his eight thousand plus collection of one.eye photographs the designer is one of the most active Korean creatives in the global community. The clout of Ahn’s contributions to Korean typography has granted him numbers of awards including Designer of the Year from Design Magazine from as early as 1983 recipient of the GRAND PRIX from ZGRAF 8 in 1998 and the 2007 Gutenberg Prize. He continues to educate young designers at Hongik University and this commitment on the education went further by opening the education cooperative and designers community Paju Typography Institute in 2012. In addition Ahn disseminates his radical innovations through the publication of the experimental art and culture magazine bogoseo/bogoseo [report/report] which he started in 1988 also with his friend gumnuri. In 2017 Seoul Museum of Art invites Ahn Sang-soo to appreciate his lifelong achievement and ongoing practice and he then introduces a significant changes of concept with the series of new letter paintings hollyeora & #40;心流& #41; [be immersed]. This series goes against the ‘Korean Modernism’ accomplished by the ahn sang-soo font when he pulled Hangul out from its entrapment in the frame of tradition of Chinese characters and evokes again the time of tradition of Chinese characters which had existed before Hangul was born. The letters become a kind of secret code and incantation that calls forth memories of a future that is soon to come. And this perception reminds us of letters containing something beyond the visible dimension and means of communication.  Ahn’s achievement and influence is variety and even infinite throughout forms of book design editorial design font design logotype and poster design that are all centered by letters as well as devoted himself on publication writing and education. These numerous practice is actually rooted on the spirit of design itself which connects arts with technology and ‘poetry’ with the world. This spirituality and aesthetics of movement reminds us of the European art and culture history during early 20th century when modern design first came into the world. However Ahn’s typography is not only limited in simple engineering and aesthetic issue. His typography is about designing a frame of liberation on human life and spirit throughout Hangul as the embodiment of ethnic and humane idea. We sincerely hope that the exhibition opens up varied access to connect with the spirituality of typography as an ultimate language of art.","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2018%2F&FILE_NM=20180517105130_802ffe0c0cfd453eb41a19412d29f812_a4e64de656b344b6b841a4646d3701e4"

The 24th Seoul Olympic Games were held under the slogan of 'Harmony and Progress' the biggest Olympic event with 160 countries. On September 19th 1979 it was started to bring in. In September 1981 the official Olympic Games were decided. From the moment we were ready to host the Olympics to the end it was no wonder that many people& #39;s cooperation and efforts followed the successful Olympics. Seoul Museum of Art was established at Seosomun-dong 37 the present location from 2000 but temporarily opened its doors to the premiere of the Olympic Games in Seoul on August 20 1988. Strictly 88 Seoul Olympics is the starting point of Seoul Museum of Art. 1988 Seoul Olympic Festival of Arts and Culture & #40;currently the Art Olympic& #41; which presents the symbolic meaning of the Olympics to the world as a culture is lacking in the cultural infrastructure to hold the event. Therefore Seoul Museum of Art Seoul Arts Center The cultural facility will be ready at the end of the preparation period of three years and will have a big event. Seoul Museum of Art also hosted official art events such as the 88 Seoul Art Festival. Seoul Museum of Art collected works related to the Olympics which was the starting point of the museum The collections related to the Olympic Games were packed as they were donated by the artist or bought and found works related to the Olympics. Based on the collection related to the Olympics this exhibition take a look at the & #39;Olympics& #39; the starting point of the Seoul Museum of Art as a collection and hope to have an opportunity to read about our art which we were about to show at the 1988 Seoul Olympics.

The starting point of this exhibition is the ideological avant-garde art of Latin America which came into existence against the backdrop of the global rise of political radicalization which occurred along with the French revolt of May 1968. However this starting point is not merely a narrative of the particularities of the political events that were and are still being recorded in history nor is it just a statement on the social significance and importance of the avant-garde movement of the time. The reason this exhibition is looking back on the avant-garde movement is to examine the points at which the historical proposition of the avant-garde movement “integration of art and life” becomes divided or ignited according changes in the existing social order and to investigate the aesthetic methods by which art gains its vitality. The vitality of art can only kick into gear when art becomes a cultural and political comment on a society before being simply a beautiful material or practice. Therefore this exhibition explores the complicated beauty deeply engraved in the sociopolitical context of the colonial modernity collectively experienced by the non-Western world including Korean.</p><p data-empty='true'><br></p><p>The various forms of the avant-garde movement triggered by modernization in the non-Western world become decisive events in the forming of the “identity” of art by elevating the state of local art and its surrounding context to a more active level. In Latin America the Conceptual avant-garde movement arose in various forms around the 1960s a development that later became an important standard of measure for understanding “Latin American Conceptual Art” or “Southern Conceptualism” which is now well known to us. Meanwhile Minjung Art in Korea became combined with the struggle of the people during the turbulent period of the 1980s and sought after various forms of media and art but is often evaluated as having failed to achieve the ‘universal language of art’ as it did not manage to connect with the Western practices of Conceptual Art. The political and aesthetic experiments of this time in Korea have therefore remained a yet unsolved issue of the regionalism of the time in which art was practiced under the shadow of the West.</p><p data-empty='true'><br></p><p>The 14 artists &amp; #40;team&amp; #41; invited to this exhibition were gathered not because of their geographical status but because they are conscious about problems related to the postcolonial perspective subjectivity and the community having passed through the experience of Western imperialism cultural hierarchy hybrid culture and the history of modernization and dictatorship. Not all of the 30+ pieces of art invited here are direct remarks on this kind of local context. Some of the artists instead pay attention to the ethnographic beauty of “the indigenous people” that might be unfamiliar in the language of contemporary art as well as the nature and object that are categorized under “culture” while reflecting on and inquiring into contemporary art from within the world view that existed before the modern era.</p><p data-empty='true'><br></p><p>Working for the Future Past is not an exhibition aimed towards the simple transmission of information about ‘another’ culture by enumerating the works and the artists of other regions. Instead it proposes awareness of the real and unavoidable constraints and boundaries within which local art operates as the language of Western modernity and to “Latin America” as a way to cross these boundaries. Rather than a return to the uncertain past or promise of a dreamlike future our aim is to use this exhibition as a mirror in the hope of finding a more appropriate path here and now. Profound understanding of these works will pave the way for us to enter the communal realm of “global yet regional art”.</p><p data-empty='true'><br></p><p><br></p><p data-empty='true'><br></p>","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192849_2a902d4e10654964a60bf0651f17cc03_c7143df463f844a9bf1150e80d238934"

The achievements of women graphic designers have received little attention by the male-dominated approaches to historical research especially in the field of graphic design that generally lacks documentation and discussion.  Another factor in women’s work remaining anonymous is due to the social circumstances wherein which women graphic designers experience difficulties in advancing their careers beyond certain limits within particular social organizations such as corporations and educational institutions. This exhibition is the beginning of a long-term effort to document and celebrate the activities of women graphic designers that are different from the male-centered historical perspectives and narratives which are prevalent in the field of Korean graphic design.  The exhibition presents the major accomplishments of ninety one women graphic designers that have each made a mark in the history of Korean graphic design. Their names and achievements include the following: Nami Rhee from Studio BAF who edited and designed the women’s magazine Eve Heesun Seo who designed the first issue of the lifestyle magazine WAY Jimi An who runs Alma Books Dongshin Kim who runs Dongshinsa Hyunkyung Kim from Hongdesign and Yunjeong Ahn from Designpark Hyewon Sohn from Crosspoint who branded Chamisul Soju Woogyung Geel and Heesun Kim who branded the Hyundai Department Store Food Hall Yeounjoo Park who designed the complete works of William Shakespeare from Moonji Publishing and Jiwon Yu who designed the complete works of William Shakespeare from Minumsa Publishing. However this archive is still a rough and incomplete collection of works that has been gathered as if quickly scanning the stage from front to back. The exhibition did not follow a thorough and objective standard for selecting works thus many great women graphic designers are not yet included. In other words this archive should be conceived as a suggestion that is open to debate and renewal rather than a closed list like the & #39;hall of fame.’ The exhibition guide will be installed inside and outside of the exhibition space even though the audience has the freedom to choose the order means and attitudes to view the archive. Yeounjoo Park suggests the audience’s attitude to exhibition asking to visit the exhibition space. The formless list of graphic designers is materialized into photos and installed in the exhibition space by Texture on Texture. Euddeum Yang installs the extended captions of 85 works and look beyond the work. Eunjoo Hong recovers the tendency presented by rearranging the list. Small Studio Semi shouts out the names of designers. On the one side of the exhibition hall Woo! School recommends Feminism in the view of reading the archive. We reinterpret the archive to connect the past present and future of Korean women graphic designers.

Urban development began in the 1960s in Seoul with the opening of roads apartments and high-rise buildings the Gangnam area which was a paddy field grew rapidly into a city. With the expansion of space and the driving force of urban growth many people gathered on the narrow and narrow land and the present Gangnam was born.

This exhibition focuses on the expanded relationship between mapping and space particularly in the city. Compared with natural spaces or rural areas which are mostly located outside cities the city is a contested zone in and through which new modes of production socio-political actions and relations are competitively generated to seize a dominant position in exercising decisive force. In other words the city can be a proper place to provide more chances to perceive and experience the transformation and conflicts of existing relations and systems in an encounter with new spatial rule and perception. In some countries particularly South Korea people tend to use the spaces of the city more actively than those of other countries not only because over 50% of total population in South Korea are concentrated in the cities but also because in many cases spaces are used simply as an essential means for earning more profits such as competitive development investment of residential and commercial places and the occupation and transformation of public spaces. Considering the complex spatiality and spatialization of the cities in South Korea mapping cannot be understood from a single unitary perspective as a space is not a fixed entity but constantly produced and changed in its interrelationship with different forces movements relations and perceptions. ‘Mapping the City’ concerns ways in which mapping can act as new form of collecting producing coding decoding recording & #40;re& #41;ordering and visualizing existing spatial knowledge and relations in and through the space of art; and how contemporary changes in perceiving and understanding the world alter the meaning and practice of mapping. The exhibition is structured in four different spaces perspectives and methods of mapping the city. By developing the idea of mapping these four artworks visualize specific aspects moments or places which have been forgotten overlooked or invisible covered with dominant powers and systems of urban space in South Korea.  ?

The works in this exhibition examine the social political and cultural events that have shaped British artistic practice since the 1980s. Rather than focusing on historic narrative participating artists explore the differences derived from social class and identity and the negotiation of political and social division through their individual practices voices and artworks.   Jeremy Deller and Alan Kane’s Folk Archive contains over 280 artifacts providing a thought-provoking foundation from which to look into British traditions cultures and identities. The photographs of Martin Parr and Paul Graham capture traces of conflict and division encoded in everyday life. Grayson Perry’s large-scale tapestry tackles what it might mean to call oneself British today by combining themes common to the lives of communities and individuals and Mark Wallinger’s video installation gently undermines Britain’s preoccupation with class and hierarchy. Mona Hatoum Lubaina Himid John Akomfrah and Samson Kambalu remind us of what it means to exist differently and their works use personal experience and narrative to critically engage with ideas of identity and belonging. Works by Cally Spooner Rachel Maclean Bob and Roberta Smith Wolfgang Tillmans and Ed Hall as artists as well as citizens address some of the urgent issues facing present-day Britain expressing a range of political positions and finding resonance with earlier work by Gillian Wearing.   Together the exhibition delves deep into the ‘dissonance’ inherent in any society where different people come together to voice their individual and shared concerns. The diversity of subject matter explored demonstrates the richness of artistic practice that has emerged in Britain in response to social cultural and political changes since the 1980s. Weaving together both new and historic artworks the exhibition celebrates the artist’s voice suggesting the possibilities to make our own voice heard within society. We hope the exhibition will create a forum ? a dissonant space ? where each artist’s voice may find its own expression.

The Self-Evolving City explores the East Asian spatial concept based on unity with nature which can be shared between architecture and contemporary art and the vision of self-evolving future city architecture through the theme of ‘Self-Evolving’ in an attempt to examine sustainable city space and life.  As a megacity that represents East Asia Seoul also faces issues related to urbanization which are directly linked to the issues of life. Through this exhibition we intend to accentuate the fact that modern cities are not simply built as a result of urban planning but are actually evolving with their own characteristic life force. Furthermore the exhibition will be an attempt at new interpretations discovering the self-evolving factors hidden within the traditions of Korean architecture and thereby actively connecting them to the vision of future self-evolving cities.  The Self-Evolving City exhibition consists of four sections. The first section is downtown Seoul centered on the Fortress Town of Hanyang. When it was developed as a new capital with the foundation of the Joseon Dynasty in 1392 its main facilities were initially planned out according to the Confucian layout concept and sited by geomancy and from then on changed in space and form through urban evolution. Although it underwent fundamental changes especially in the process of modernization the modern architects of Korea have designed buildings in a way that revived the traditional urban context. The second section is Gangnam Seoul which was developed in the late 1960s. Since it was built during the development era according to the modern model of a city Gangnam has emerged as the center of Seoul’s economy culture and education. In this exhibition we will be showing the ideology of modern urban planning that appeared in the process of Gangnam’s birth along with the creation and evolution of new types of architecture that correspond to it such as apartments offices and neighborhood facilities. The third section covers the two new towns of Songdo and Sejong which were newly built around the year 2000. Although these two new towns have exposed many differences in their foundational background and process we can find attempts to overcome modern models in these cities and they also show coincidence with important concepts of self-evolution. And the last section of this exhibition will be an exhibition of the winning works for the International Open Idea Competition for the Self-Evolving City of the Future along with artistic interpretations by artists about future cities and life.  The Self-Evolving City exhibition will reexamine the transformation process of Korean architecture and cities through the two perspectives of planning and evolution and explore what is necessary to create a future city with the potential for self-evolution. Above all we hope that through this exhibition the audiences will be able to gain a richer experience of how art is integrating the city architecture and our lives through its unique power of imagination as it attempts to solve the urban issues of today.

Our & #40;Mo Kim Rho Eunjoo Enna Bae Joungmin Yi mixrice and Daejin Choi& #41; initial meeting for A Summer Place happened in March 2017. We came up with thousands of words - summer resort exile romance camping etc. imagining the exhibition taking place during the vacation season in an artist residency which also had to be done collectively in site. In our consecutive meetings we realized that situations at the moment - impeachment refrigerator heat monsoon etc. are not only intervening but interrupting our thoughts for the exhibition.  Our exhibition inevitably will be anchored in here/now. Even though here/now would not meet our expectation we had to question ourselves the condition that forms the present. Perhaps contemporaneity could be attained in the moment when delayed time reveals the valid possibility of its own existence.  A Summer Place is the very day when the past of mine meets the future of ours. For 10 days starting from the end of July we will draw make write and move together invading your place and withdrawing my place in the exhibition space at Nanji.

Our & #40;Mo Kim Rho Eunjoo Enna Bae Joungmin Yi mixrice and Daejin Choi& #41; initial meeting for A Summer Place happened in March 2017. We came up with thousands of words - summer resort exile romance camping etc. imagining the exhibition taking place during the vacation season in an artist residency which also had to be done collectively in site. In our consecutive meetings we realized that situations at the moment - impeachment refrigerator heat monsoon etc. are not only intervening but interrupting our thoughts for the exhibition.  Our exhibition inevitably will be anchored in here/now. Even though here/now would not meet our expectation we had to question ourselves the condition that forms the present. Perhaps contemporaneity could be attained in the moment when delayed time reveals the valid possibility of its own existence.

This year we present Tchah Sup Kim the first generation Korean diaspora artist along with Sojung Jun a young generation artist who is interested in investigating our condition of life in the worldwide socio-economic structure of free trade and globalization. Putting the two artist’s works together this exhibition tries to examine and compare their views on the ‘border identity’ in the context of international migration. Kim believes that we need to read the spirit of the times embedded in artworks based one’s own understanding of his or her time. On the other hand Jun adopts the methods of ‘diff?rance’ addressing the problems of global market economy simultaneously taking place in the entire world. She shows a playful attitude and cosmopolitanism on the common matters. We would like to explore the influence of nationalism in Kim’s works and the constant and fluid changes of modes of life showcased in Jun’s works.","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192849_5349ff94aa594a8d9d7edc22901b38d7_2772bfd8e0524b14aaf4b2fe51dbb30d"

From abroad the period was marked by the conflicting ideologies of the Cold War from the Vietnam War and anti-war protests to the U.S. and Soviet space race and the Apollo 11 landing on the moon. It was also a time when the groundbreaking space technology seemed to promise a new beginning for humanity. On the cultural dimension a spirit of resistance dominated with the youth subculture alongside the hippie and psychedelic movements coexisting in multiple narratives within the realm of popular culture.  Asian Diva: The Muse and the Monster examines how those political and cultural influences of the West have been woven into the local context of postcolonial cultures in Korea and other countries in Southeast Asia. More specifically the exhibition focuses on the stigmatized subcultures of the period under the violence and repression of the military order under Yushin indoctrination as well as the women and minorities of the time who have been marginalized to the fringes of the strictly male-centered patriarchic society. The exhibition introduces the popular culture of Korea Japan and Southeast Asia from the 1960s and & #39;70s represented by cultural icons such as Kim Chooja and Hahn Dae-soo examining the postcolonial experiences in the region through the lens of pop culture by exploring a wide range of issues centering on the realities of women gender and sexuality and more broadly the Cold War and political dictatorship.  Presenting works by contemporary artists including Kim Soyoung Rho Jae Oon Park Chan Kyong Arahmaiani Yoshiko Shimada siren eun young jung and Jane Jin Kaisen together with the geometric abstraction and experimental art of the 1960s and & #39;70s by artists Kim Ku-lim Park Seo-Bo and Sung Neungkyung Asian Diva: The Muse and the Monster highlights the spirit of resistance and the zeitgeist captured in the artworks. The exhibition also displays a selection of works by the artist Chun Kyung-ja from her years as a military painter during the Vietnam War in addition to a wide- ranging archive of cultural memorabilia including a personal collection and recordings of the singer Kim Chooja which are presented to the public for the first time.

The exhibition aims to illuminate unnoticed artworks and areas within SeMA’s collection. As its first attempt the museum is focusing on its contemporary craft collections.   Crafts is one of the longest surviving forms of art. However its definition has been constantly challenged by fundamental questions raised by the changing notion of art and the process of industrialization. In the process of discussion new forms of craftworks based on aesthetic expression rather than functionality deviating from its expected quality of practical use have played a significant role.   Rethinking Craft: Between studio craft and contemporary art consists of works from contemporary craft artists who have developed their art practices through formal experiments as well as explorations of materials and techniques. The artists are unique in their engagement with unconstrained art practices based on traditional concepts of craft and artistic expansion across different genres of art.   The exhibition tries to offer multiple angles of view on contemporary craft by presenting together various disciplines of art including paintings and sculptures that exhibit similar qualities in artistic expression and subject matter to the craftworks from the collection. Additionally the exhibition includes works that strategically appropriate traditional materials and techniques of craft thereby giving us an opportunity to re-think the meaning of craft in contemporary art.

At the time of its founding in 2006 it was a project which provided artists with studio spaces in line with the City of Seoul’s policy to invigorate unused spaces in the city. In the 10 years of the program SNR has developed a step further transforming into an artist residency program. Having produced over 300 artists and researchers from residency this archive exhibition endeavors to reflect on the memories and process of the program up to present.  The exhibition is divided into three sections. First a timeline of SNR reflects on the past pivoting on events that laid the foundation of the residency program. The second section ‘Program at NANJI’ presents major activities that demonstrate the identity of SNR as a residency program under the categories Research/Exhibition/Exchange. The empty spaces that have not been archived in the official history will be filled slowly with the memories of individual artists through video and survey in the following section.  This exhibition was produced with the cooperation of former residency artists at SNR. In addition to the survey the moments from the past were recollected in the exhibition thanks to artists and their works including the transformation of an old signpost of Nanji into an art work and reinvention of an old Lakulaku folding bed that’s been in actual use for the last 10 years into a display table.  While the exhibition wraps up the first 10 years of SNR and its process of establishing its foundation as a residency program this exhibition also presents an opportune moment to take a breath and imagine the next 10 years to come. Hopefully the questions produced in the history of the institution propel the audience to expand their minds in imagining the new possibilities for SNR.

As the title indicates Highlights not only refers to the most representative artworks from the Collection of the Fondation Cartier that will be on display but also implies our wish to share the heightened shining value of art which represents various crucial subjects that we need to pay attention to through visual and verbal languages.   For the exhibition Highlights SeMA and the Fondation Cartier selected 100 representative works among 1500 artworks in the Collection of the Fondation Cartier including the works of Sarah Sze Ron Mueck and Moebius. Based on common interests beyond national and gender dierences these works are signicant for their multidisciplinary approaches to diverse social phenomena which we expect to be easily shared with the Korean audience. The exhibition Highlights oers the opportunity to discover a series of works subliming diverse subjects into artworks. The work Hear Them Speak by French artists Raymond Depardon and Claudine Nougaret recorded languages and dialects in danger of extinction representing the subject in the form of a beautiful lm. Diller Scodio + Renfro’s EXIT installation is a 360° visualization of human migrations and causes based on an idea by French philosopher and urbanist Paul Virilio.

The rst Korean artist to having hold a solo exhibition at the Fondation Cartier in 2007 Lee Bul will reveal her work Heaven and Earth to the Korean audience.   This exhibition will also actively introduce extraordinary commissions by emerging artists who have not had opportunities in mainstream art scenes. For this particular show the Fondation Cartier fully supported the artists’ duo PARKing CHANce formed by the lm director Park Chan-wook and artist Park Chan-kyong so that the brothers could create a new project entitled Decades Apart.

It is also becoming more widely acceptable nowadays to recognize such passion and proficiency. The landscape of the dukhoo universe is also changing as diversified facets of media production and distribution are allowing more people to express their individuality while sharing common interests and communicating information with others. Project Dukhoo: Finding Flow observes the temperament gestures and behaviors of dukhoo that are uniquely acquired in the process of “finding flow” the act of engaging their passion in various realms. By highlighting their significance in the context of changing social awareness the exhibition examines the contemporary sociocultural phenomenon defined by the term dukhoo.   The eleven artists participating in this group exhibition present a diverse spectrum of works across genre and medium that delve into the cultural phenomenon of dukhoo. Some explore the boundaries between everyday life and art by engaging in hobbies that reveal their artistic attitudes or by collecting objects that closely reflect their creative inspiration and the trends of pop culture. Others experiment with creating new context by appropriating the languages or production methods specific to their areas of interest such as anime films while some artists probe the systems of production and consumption as well as the stereotypes of dukhoo in ways of examining the dynamics of cultural trends. There are also works that invite the viewers to experience the “essence of dukhoo” and by doing so challenge the stereotypes that disregard the act of “finding flow” as meaningless.   What the dukhoo phenomenon indicates to our culture today is the values implied in the act of “finding flow” understanding one’s inner needs and dedicating oneself to achieve it. As both diversity and professionalism are becoming more recognized in our society such commitment to oneself may inspire more proactive attitudes toward life. By exploring the phenomenon of dukhoo the exhibition hopes to shed light on one of the most significant subcultures of our time and share the experience of “finding flow” with the viewers.    *& #41; Dukhoo is a shortened form of odukhoo a term adopted by Korean internet users to pronounce the Japanese word otaku meaning “a person with obsessive interests.”  ","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192849_3ab7a491df994f6bbde5c97190b5cc9e_4a1cc1dfb9504e44ac1f695f1981f885"

The present exhibition is based on an analogy between the disappearing social communities in modern life with the words and acts of greetings that is also disappearing in contemporary societies.   Seeing a stranger and saying Hello to them enables people to recognize the unknown other and start to explore the possibility of approaching the inner world of each other. When the practice of greeting becomes a habit and a routine it also becomes institutionalized as a means or a social convention that makes possible the caring and concerning for the members of community.  The nine artists participating in the current exhibition are outsiders: but they act as ‘catalysts’ in that they deeply infiltrate into the regional community and invite others to engage in the community members’ life. The artists’ engagement moreover requires the members to participate in the process of their art making. The ambivalent feelings of awkwardness and intimacy aroused between insiders and strangers are familiar to everyone. We know the feelings from our repeated experience of meeting and relating with other people.   During the past six months nine artists built up relationship with residents and the history of five districts in northeast region of Seoul. The artists’ work helped the members of the communities recognize their own existence and each other’s and restore the sensus communis & #40;in Kantian philosophy& #41; which is urgently required in the age of virtual relationship and dispersed online communities.

This exhibition was designed as the artists discussed how to put their works together within the unique exhibition space of SeMA Storage & #40;an annex of SeMA& #41;.   NANJI 10th artists and researchers reunited at SeMA Storage on a weekday afternoon on February 8th 2017 & #40;a month after they moved out from their studios& #41;. Leaving behind the delight of seeing each other for a moment while discussing their ideas the artists thoroughly checked out the space to decide which works to exhibit and how to display them.  The artists got to better understand each other’s work during their yearlong stay at SeMA NANJI RESIDENCY because through & lt;NANJI ART SHOW& gt; series they were able to work with each other many times in the past. & lt; NANJI ART SHOW & gt; is a program that the artists hold continuous meetings and sharing ideas about each others’ work at the beginning of their stay at the residency and realize a group exhibition. Because of this experience the artists were able to progress smoothly in selecting and displaying their works even though the task could have been quite a difficult process. Meanwhile we asked them for deions of their works which are required in the gallery for its audience to help their better understand and for its catalogue. The writings sented by NANJI 10th artists were very well articulated so we only had to go through minor revisions and proofreading.  As the research program of SeMA NANJI RESIDENCY there are & lt;Art Critique Workshop& gt; which continued on from before and & lt;Abstract Workshop& gt; was held for the first time last year with the 10th Nanji residents. & lt;Abstract Workshop& gt; is the educational program where artists were able to practice in communicating the ideas behind their works. Guided by an art critic the artists learned about the definitions necessities and methodologies of annotation. Then they wrote about their own practices discussing and revising afterwards. We believe that this process has much improved the artists’ writing skills. So it is with no exaggeration to say that the selection of works and their interpretations for this exhibition were solely produced by NANJI 10th artists and researchers. I would also like to add that the artists took the lead in the curation of the exhibition fully utilizing the unique architectural space of SeMA Storage.   Repurposing the reagent warehouse building of the pharmaceutical testing laboratory of the former Center for Disease Control and Prevention established in the 1960s SeMA Storage is an alternative art space run by SeMA. This unique space maintains the architectural framework that was previously used & #40;such as the wooden shelves and structures& #41; revealing traces of time. The artists select works that are suited for the rough features of the space. We can see the similarities and connections between the experimental and inquisitive tendencies of their art practices and the nature of the space & #40;a site that previously stored chemicals& #41;.   SeMA NANJI RESIDENCY 10th Review & lt;Report &Recall& gt; has Korean title & lt;bogo-sib-da& gt; which is a form of wordplay. The term ’sib’ means ‘ten’ referring to NANJI 10th and the term ‘bogo’ possesses multiple meanings such as ‘reporting & #40;報告& #41;’’ the artists’ treasure ‘troves & #40;寶庫& #41;’ and ‘a trove & #40;寶庫& #41;’ & #40;as a precious storage of works& #41;. In other words we can interpret this as “an exhibition where one desires to look again and again at the various works and research achievements of NANJI 10th artists and researchers.”  We hope this exhibition attracts people to return and see the works again and again recalling the artworks and the artists’ experimental spirit which is presented inside this space that captures the atmosphere of the past.& #40;PARK Soon-young& #41; ","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192849_cfdad68e3b8c44358a540492f74536c1_71310d8761974a2cac563806ce9ab0f3"

On nalgae section the exhibition explores the series of letter paintings of Ahn from the early period starting from Ahn Sang-soo font to recent works including hollyula & #40;being immersed& #41; canvas painting seires. Most of his previous works are digitized to offer us to experience abstract sensation and visual appreciation of Hangul letters distanced from their social meaning and conventional uses. They are rather closer to pictographic or hieroglyphic arrangement of Hangul alphabets by recomposing our perception on the conventional understanding on the language Hangul. The original sources were created throughout Ahn’s lifetime career as a graphic designer and visual communicator who has continually seek for his own language as a creator in this specific region of South Korea. His experiment consists destructing rearranging and restyling of Korean alphabets in varied forms including letter typing drawing rubbing calligraphy painting and performance. His love and respect upon Hangul has expanded to the core spirit of Paju Typography Institute for finding the most of our own education rooted on ‘doing design’ and ‘designing life’.

Starting from the establishment of institute there is the photographic and text materials of varied events including construction of yisangjib & #40;undergraduate building& #41; freshman orientation welcoming ceremony and visiting Yeongneung & #40;tomb of King Sejong the Hangul creator& #41; to series of curriculums and projects that every participants of PaTI has ‘designed’ and worked together for last five years. The archive is not only for offering basic information of the school but also for sharing multi-layered philosophy of them as a whole and on-going experiment which aims at finding our own educational language. The series of workshops designed by PaTI teachers are also prepared to invite the potential community of the museum in order to experience PaTI and PaTI’s idea in depth. This is for performing the archive in the exhibition space and for expanding their pedagogical idea into social structure. Besides them series of small programs designed by students of PaTI is also invited for revealing issues and topics of young generation which offer us at the same time to think about future designers and about designing life in different forms in contemporary society.

Focusing on our society’s collective experiences such as “estranged labor” and increasing “social instability” which in turn create “excluded and marginalized existences” the works in this exhibition demonstrate critical awareness of the social situation. Selected primarily from SeMA’s permanent collection the artworks have been interwoven together based on the socio-cultural codes we presently share instead of being categorized by time period genre and form. From these social codes that are familiar to us through film and literature the viewers will be able to access the multilayered textures and substances of the works.  The exhibition is organized into three sections. The first section examines the marginal beings on the boundaries of society that lead meaningless lives only to gratify their desires. Standing at the edge of globalized neoliberalism where anything can be done for the sake of profit we voluntarily lend ourselves to slavery of capitalism for our own consumption & #40;Eternal Slaves& #41; and pursue our private desires over social introspection or critical awareness & #40;Bodies Laden with Desire& #41;. These collective experiences are reflected into codes of repetitive labor and selfish attitudes that have been vividly portrayed in a wide array of films and television dramas. The works included in this section visualize these issues by making a parody of meaningless repetitive actions or revealing the invisible structures of consumer capitalism and those who are dominated by the objects of desire. In addition this section of the exhibition also juxtaposes works that investigate the boundary objects that are structuralized as much as the humans under social conditions.  The second section of the exhibition explores marginal groups as sites where social instability and desire are unveiled. Minorities & #40;Invisible People& #41; who were often excluded and hidden from history have been suppressed by the authority and the mainstream in order to consolidate the system. Nevertheless minorities have never been forgotten and are constantly revived in our memories. Young people & #40;Convenience Store Human& #41; with their livelihood showing no signs of improvement despite the struggles project themselves onto the excluded characters in webtoons and novels taking them on as their alter ego while reconstructing the narrative as a way of breaking the ties. These works delve into moments when the familiar turns into the unfamiliar and react to their conditions by raising questions on social perceptions and standards.   Lastly the works on display at the Project Gallery2 focus more on hopeful destruction. These works assert that we must acknowledge and overcome our own foolishness in order to break away from this state where we cannot be ourselves that we should not label and restrict the underprivileged and that it is essential for us to recover our sense of humanity.   The economic crisis various calamities & #40;such as nuclear disasters earthquakes and the nationwide spread of MERS& #41; and terror incidents are increasingly becoming a part of our everyday anxieties and horrors. It may also be true that the Korean society has been trapped in stagnation and guilt for quite some time but it is clear that even in the present moment the Korean people continue to search for hope by joining forces together. The works in this exhibition are those that have tried to catch these signs early on and interpret them. The exhibition and the artworks hope to provide an opportunity to recover our lost sense of direction and find ways to move forward.

SeMA Gold is part of the special biennial exhibition series; SeMA Green for senior artists; SeMA Gold for mid-career artists; and SeMA Blue for emerging artists. Geared towards mid-career artists who have already established their own artistic practices and are at the forefront of the Korean art scene SeMA Gold invites artists to participate and respond to its given themes. Different from its previous incarnations this year SeMA Gold focuses on the 1990s a turning point in Korean art and attempts to reflect on the significance of contemporary Korean art in aesthetics and cultural history.  Symptoms that signify milestones in the 1990s ― the 90s’ zeitgeist that differentiates itself from the 70s and the 80s are sensed in the post-ideological practices of Generation X who represented this era. To be more specific we can see small groups of movements and projects that re-codified the various cultural signifiers of the time such as art technology mass media and subcultures into an emancipated underground language.  The 1990s have already become a new cultural keyword through a recent TV soap opera & #39;Reply& #39; series gaining lots of popularity. Summoning the 1990s in the name of contemporary art this exhibition focuses on the paradigm shifts of contemporary art ― Postmodernism and Globalism― and focuses on its influence on today& #39;s art and dynamic relations. This will become an opportunity to illuminate the art historical achievements of the leading artists from Generation X who as enfant-terribles shifted the ground of the Korean art world in the 1990s.  X: Korean Art in the 1990s constructs the exhibition’s narrative by reconstructing works from that era and amassing various archives. In regards to the concern that this retrospective exhibition might become a simple historicization or sentimentalist nostalgia the exhibition re-contextualizes art of the 90s within the specificity of its time and place focusing on visualizing its continuity with the present. I would like to thank all the participating artists who have shown us regard and have given us such tremendous support by presenting works and lending materials.","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192849_a24d9586e52940108ca0db006a57d940_0ca3a209706244be8d6143650d8ac632"

Master Hyun Bae Lee accepted the difficult challenges of modernizing Onggi believing that it can be adapted to modern life style. He has devoted the past 26 years to creating aesthetically and functionally outstanding Onggi whilst using the traditional creation process. To him ‘Today’s Onggi’ signify the cycle where all things are born from the earth and eventually return to their origin as Onggi will return as a traditional household item.   This exhibition is significant because it fully explores the complete works of Master Lee so far and his oeuvre can be separated into three categories.   First of all Onggi possess beautiful forms. Onggi’s aesthetic value has been underestimated due to its humble nature in comparison to porcelain. Yet Master Lee has firmly made aesthetical approaches toward traditional Onggi. The shoulder of his Dok & #40;Hang-ari& #41; is wider than the normal Southern style and the ‘Jeon’ & #40;lips& #41; are firmly constructed so that less deformation is caused during the drying or baking process resulting in a better form with dynamic features. The texture of the rough soil the subtle red hidden in the chocolate color induced by burning firewood and the naturally flowing simple lines together constitute an exceptionally immaculate beauty.  Furthermore Master Lee reinterprets the existing shape of Onggi. He has employed the beauty of the modern cylindrical shape of Gonjaengyi Jeot Dok into beautiful a rice container and tall vase which create a harmonious contemporary residential environment.  Additionally his lotus bud shaped Danji which resembles Jangdok that are buried underground during the winter season and Jara bottles that have been transformed into a stylish interior object for decoration are great examples of the mater’s endeavor to bring out the natural beauty of Onggi’s shape.   Second Onggi plays various roles in contemporary food culture. Master Lee believes that traditional Onggi is essential in achieving the authentic flavor of Korea’s fermented food. Any modern Onggi produced by mechanical processes cannot replicate the flavor ― in terms of fermenting ripening and preserving freshness ? of traditionally made Onggi. Master Lee has suggested that an average household needed 7 Jangdok in the 90s and now proposes 5-7 Jangdok for smaller households to preserve fermented pastes and seasonings. In this exhibition his various tableware and cookware are displayed in the form of table settings for a single person. These tables aim to explore today’s food culture such as a simple noodle dish western table settings the espresso cup ‘Umji’ with a coffee roaster ‘Yakson’ which is designed to easily warm a pack of oriental herbal medicine and the ‘Y?ol Green Set’ that reduces the shrill sound created when cutlery touches the surface of rough Onggi.  Finally Master Lee has been making Onggi faithful to its own nature. He says that in order to make a true ‘breathing Onggi’ one must be able to build a solid body using soft soil coat its skin with the natural glaze and bake thoroughly inside a wood fired kiln.  Lee’s ability to shape build and fire the pottery in a traditional kiln is based on the deep understanding of the shapes and materiality of Onggi and this knowledge has been applied to restore the ancient technology for producing large jar coffins found in the area of Naju National Research Institute of Cultural Heritage.  Meanwhile ‘breathing’ does not only refer to ‘air-permeability’. The master has faith that Onggi finally become themselves when they are used in our daily lives living and breathing with us. Like the zinc ashtray translated Square Onggi he wants Onggi to breath in our kitchen storage and porches.   In the end it will be more meaningful if the audience can discover the intersection of tradition and modern life art and life by imagining how and in which form the exhibited Onggi can be utilized in each of our living spaces.

This exhibition explores the dynamics of the institution and its exhibitions which is as much about the shifts in the concept and form of exhibitions as it is about the changes in the museum’s policy and role during different phases.   A select use of resources from past exhibitions is the pivot on which this exhibition turns as it demonstrates the transitions of SeMA according to the demands of each period.

When audiences choose to take the initiative the history of the museum can be read written and spoken in various ways instead of being fixed into a closed narrative.

Buk-Seoul Museum of Art’s Children’s Gallery organizes exhibitions that combine viewing and experiences in order to familiarize children and families to contemporary art making it more accessible.   The point & #40;which is the beginning of a shape& #41; a line & #40;which has a direction& #41; and a plane & #40;which creates area and space& #41; are the basic elements of art. These elements are needed in order for humans to perceive objects and spaces around them and to express feelings and thoughts in a formal language. Understanding the point line and plane is an important step in the pedagogy of children and their aesthetic experience. Based on this understanding Point·Line·Plane invites the artist Hong Seung-Hye who has long carried out experiments ―both in content and form― with spaces constructed by the pixel ― the smallest unit of the digital image. Hong’s Organic Geometry series which imbues natural qualities such as irregularity and contingency to the cold geometric elements of point line and plane began as abstract images on computer screens and has expanded to different forms such as real objects & #40;like furniture& #41; videos and music. Based on the artist’s own practice this exhibition aims to provide children a new experience of point line and plane.  Consisting of new works that reflect various qualities of point line and plane the exhibition is divided into two categories. First there is a pedagogical mural and videos that show the process in which points expand to lines and planes. Partitioning the space anew painted square frames that are placed in different areas in the exhibition space look like independent planes separated from the existing architecture. Additionally the creation and variation of point line and plane are demonstrated through a work of wall stickers that depict constellations circles and squares. Also a flash animation that shows moving geometric figures that looks like dancing through sound created by the artist.     In another vein there are installations that construct daily objects from geometric figures. Objects that are easily recognizable by anyone such as a jungle gym stools tables and pushmobiles encourage the audience’s bodily engagement while imparting familiarity and abstraction. In the process of touching and moving objects that are reduced to geometric shapes yet still closely related to our lives viewers might be able to think again about familiar and seemingly natural forms and spaces.   This exhibition is organized to help children easily learn the concept of point line and plane. Moreover beyond a simple visual appreciation of artworks it allows the audience to play and communicate with each other. Through this process we expect the audience to experience the infinite possibilities of point line and plane and see anew the objects and spaces found in the everyday environment.

The selected artists create their works within the unique environment and circumstances surrounding the studio using this as material. The 5 artists take this place ‘Nanji’ as their subject material and meaning producing new site-specific projects that are distinguished - in terms of methodology and content - from their works prior to joining the residency. In an art context a specific site generally refers to the space of an exhibition but “Nanjido Flux” is studio site specific.   In the south between Haneul Park and Noeul Park & #40;a reclaimed dump-site& #41; SeMA NANJI RESIDENCY is located far away from the usual areas of dwelling. NANJI RESIDENCY is surrounded by artificially built ecological parks. There is not much public transportation around the area. An Italian artist who recently joined the International Artist Exchange Program said that Seoul unlike his original expectation was a very quiet city ? a double culture shock. Last summer when an excavator dug into the ground next to the studio in order to install hydrogen fuel cells the neat piles of trash uncovered proved that NANJI RESIDENCY was indeed built on dump-site. The disposal facility between the studio buildings was closed long ago however the building remains showing the scene of a bygone era of industrialization. The huge smokestack of the District Heating Corporation at the north end is a landmark that also marks this site as an old dump-site. These contradictory and inharmonious elements of Nanji are enough to stimulate the artists’ imaginations.   Hyewon Kwon who had interest in the history of this region even before NANJI RESIDENCY was established tracks the archives of the National Archives of Korea KTV Korean Federation of Film Archives newspaper archives university libraries and the archives of 3 major broadcasting companies. Furthermore she employs fiction television dramas and films set in Nanji as background to help enhance her works bringing detail and liveliness. As Nanji has four seasons and its changing climate is distinctively felt the sensitive artists feel every minute differently. Fay Shin spreads a huge cloth on the empty ground near the studio building upon which she lays various forms and objects recording the index of the weather onto the cloth that has faded through rain and sunlight. It reminds us of a childhood memory of making a cyanotype & #40;printed by sunlight with objects on paper with silver bath& #41;.  The countless bugs from the surrounding dense artificial forests have bothered many artists but have also become a great subject for the art project. Hyungsub Shin transforms insects into taxidermy giving them an appearance like they are still living and puts them into the slide carousel in order to project onto the wall of the exhibition hall. It is a real-time feedback since a real taxidermied mosquito is in the slide projector. The obsolete Nanji disposal facility becomes a playground for Bae Yoon Hwan. Even the wood pieces that previous resident artists leave outside the studios provide inspiration. For him the materials that someone discards are more comfortable than clean white canvas. Yusam Sung produces artworks using leftovers and scraps from other artists’ production processes. Working materials for Sung is the waste from other artists’ studios. This cyclical process where waste becomes an artwork’s material reflects the history of Nanji which was once a site for trash and is now a park.& #40;Hyungsub Shin& #41; ","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192849_e96cb96cad9c4a05a69261cbbb2d1044_5b6019aad2a04a2382185b9d3c50b887"

Artists can express the particularities of objects somewhat differently - nonexistence may be felt and the invisible may be seen. Through the artist’s process after numerous inspiring thoughts the artworks steadily reach their completion. While artists always try to express something and share it the audience asks questions to its ambiguous expressions. In this exhibition by presenting their visualization process their inner emotions and conceptual thoughts we intend to present an artist’s attitude toward thought and the new perspectives generated through the artists’ eyes. Hyewon Kwon’s & #39;Memory Museum - Guro& #39; tracks the history of a building in the outskirts of the Guro Industrial Complex. Kwon transforms the building into an imagined museum by mining the narratives found in its past. No records are left from this imagined museum only its intangible memories are preserved and replayed. Through the chronicling of past and present a stage for memories comes to coexist inside the present. The artist communicates how the past can be channeled into the present. From an old secret sump underground a soundtrack is recorded. Not unlike how an old sound is preserved somewhere in the building and re-played through a wall the work integrates the sounds of the whole space that are transformed as they move through the building’s structure. Bona Park is interested in how social structures - including the art system - operate and how people work to create individuality behind these structures. The artwork for this exhibition involves cropped photographs of hands from pictures of performances since 2011. By cropping around the hands of the performers these documentary photographs implicitly present information like race sex labor intensity and profession. By including a photograph of hands that have constructed the photographic frames the artist gives a nod to those whose work makes an exhibition possible. By revealing the work of those who are usually invisible the artwork intends to make subtle break in the structure. I believe this suits this exhibition’s subject visualization of the Invisibles. PARK Yoon Kyung employs a process of imaging texts and making painting installations. She presents a picture of an abstract image that possesses a different front and back. The artist says: “The process in which a text is transformed into image relates to the area that is destroyed when meaning is delivered through the frame of language.” The abstract image is read differently according to an audience’s subjectivity. The first image transmitted by the artist presents this form of meaning’s destruction. In this manner the abstract is a ground that can accept ‘disputes’ eliminating the hierarchy between artworks and audiences created by forms of unilateral communication. Furthermore the abstract facilitates an artistic space where artwork audience and space are given equivalent authority. The actual space projected through the translucent screen and through the installation suggests a picture that enables open forms of interpretation by interacting with the audience making relations with the audience. Hyungsub Shin expresses objects in a totally new form by using industrial materials and objects from daily life. What is remarkable is the artist’s perspective and mode of visual expression where he represents the form of a natural root using artificial wire or presents unbreakable objects as crushed fragments. ‘Energy Field’ is a mutable installation made from magnets and the objects that are attracted to them. In the areas that are magnetized the objects create a certain form but they are also easily deformed by other physical forces. The objects are spread on the ground to induce audience participation. From the perspective of the artist and while considering his expressive mode the audience might sense the artist’s eyes when interpreting the object’s properties. Hyunjeong Lim has interests in expressing the fairytale-like primitive world of the unconscious as a visual image. Lim does so by capturing internal scenes of an imagination and by arousing various feelings inside the viewers. The scenes in her work rearrange private imageries that are only visible to the artist raising questions about the truth of the invisible. Through her works the artist asks if creating invisible links inside other people’s minds can become a way to understand others who live through different backgrounds and cultures. Heo Suyoung repeatedly overlaps images maximizing a form of visual multiplicity. When appreciating the artwork one feels movement as if we could hear inaudible sounds. Multiple visible objects fill the scene not allowing any empty space. Not knowing when to finish the work tries to capture every visible thing. The artist continuously draws something in-between and on the drawn objects as if penetrating until she can no longer intervene. At last there is nothing more she can do and she finishes the drawing but after a while she says she can still find empty spaces. Seunghee Hong presents the depth of emotions using invisible creases. She forcefully destroys the hard unique properties of matter around an object creating an intended gravity and crease made by the sunken object that shows the depth of her emotion.

Instead of taking the title ‘curator’ for granted the exhibition attempts to unfold the many layers of thoughts that are set into motion when a curator works. The purpose of this exhibition is the sharing of empirical narratives not the suggestion of theoretical definitions or the normative roles of curating. In order to achieve this writings from active curators are collected in the form of a self-publication. This publication is produced in an ‘open binder’ format which allows new pages to be continuously added. Named ‘Adding Pages’ the concept accumulates independent narratives from curators of the same period and proposes another intention for the project. Otherwise the curators bind the narratives about ‘being curator’ in order to correspond the question constantly asked while working as curator: “Why there is no ‘story’ about this job?” Since the 2000s curators have cultivated a number of institutional strategies and & #40;as many professions of Korean society do& #41; despite a structural instability their roles have been romanticized and abstracted. In other words a universal awareness about curators in Korean society exists & #40;its professional image& #41; but its ‘discourse’ does not. After all curators of today have too many different qualities and working conditions & #40;depending on their institution& #41; to merely place into a single role and furthermore in the real world they have broad identities and play various roles from exhibition planners mediators administrators translators critics and at times counselors. Not unlike how it is not extraordinary these days that an artist himself also works as a planner a planner’s role also becomes interchangeable according to the shifts in contemporary art becoming more complicated in its definition of titles and character. Based on these issues the project intends to form a ground where curators with different positionalities and directions can share their stories about their profession and works ? subjects that until now have remained rather invisible. I hope this meeting motivates curators to share some time and ideas about their jobs with other colleagues who might be struggling and building their own context somewhere else.& #40;Eunbi Jo& #41; ","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192849_521d910425a0476aadd4f8a6f1dcea75_e0cf279b9fb84b7e9dd383f2519e68e9"

How can a curator’s research and related activities relate to an exhibition? In the series of steps to organize it the process of research in curating an exhibition fully permeates its structure. Sufficient research can formulate deeper discussions and involve more details on the exhibition’s process on topics such as theme development approaches to artworks and communication with the audience. The exhibition Pre-Micro City Lab is a kind of preface an exhibition that presents research. Starting from the research that leads to the exhibition’s curation and an open platform for discussion the exhibition attempts to share the inquiries of this journey.     From Seoul a Mega-city  Returning to Seoul from the ‘Northeast Asian Mega-cities’ research in January of 2016 I joined the SeMA Nanji Residency. It was a period when I reflected on how to approach the question of the urbanism and Seoul by looking through all of the research. First of all I wasn’t comfortable with the prescribed concept of Seoul as a Mega-city. Seoul is said to be a globalized mega-city that ranks as fifth in the world. However what kind of mega-city do we live in? I thought that it was a painfully familiar place but I felt it somewhat abstract when trying to imagine the volume of this massive city. To know this city more in depth I changed my routines. I looked around unfamiliar neighborhoods by walking down the streets in the relatively short distances and rather than take the subway I used a shuttle & #40;town& #41; bus to get around. The more I experienced the city in this way the more the spaces of life in the corners of the streets accumulated in my memory. As I experienced the city in this new way spaces that were relatively hard to approach banned or could not be used or places that were disinteresting or neglected came across my mind. As one more deeply inquires into the city the massive volume of a so-called mega-city disappears. Within a city numerous undefinable unnameable spaces exist. In these micro-spaces the activities of different lives of numerous individuals and communities take place. When the form of mega-city disappears another scenery appears:“there are numerous ‘micro-cities’ in a ‘mega-city’.”   Looking for numerous ‘micro-cities’ within us  The journey that tries to approach the site-specificity of Seoul becomes a motivation in the curation of the exhibition Micro City Lab. This project of intervening in the city will be held between October 7-31 2016. The exhibition prompts many discussions on site-specificity through ‘micro-interventions’ in which 18 teams of artists architects collectives and choreographers from 11 countries intervene in urban spaces on the micro level. During the exhibition period the participating artists’ intervention projects take place in various open spaces of Seoul such as public spaces in front of department stores parks along the streets vacant lots and unused spaces in guerilla irregular or continuous ways.  The artists’ ‘micro interventions’ will be a beginning to approach the various social relations that are involved within the space of the city. Discussions on concerns of consumerization authorization and capitalization of the city the ongoing violence in the development process of the city the self-regenerative capabilities of city spaces and an ethical consciousness of art that intervenes in these processes will continuously take place in the form of talks workshops and tours through the intervening projects’ site-specificity. Pre-Micro City Lab is a platform to open up discussions and methods of approach regarding the ‘site-specificity.’ This forum takes place prior to the main project that will be held in October. In this manner Pre-Micro City Lab presents curators’ research materials products from exhibition processes and archives of the participating artists. Before the interventions in the city begin in October I hope this exhibition can be a starting point for sharing contexts and inquiries surrounding site-specificity.& #40;Somi Sim& #41; ","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192846_0867b2cfb6d749b08033d61de05db0e3_f824d7369a8d47f4bcc79bf6be70de59"

"000294","Exhibition of Donated Artworks <Photographs by Kang Bong-kyu : Human Theater>","","Buk Seoul Museum of Art Project Gallery 1-2 ","2016-08-25","2016-12-18","","","","","","","","","","Exhibition of Donated Artworks& lt;Photographs by Kang Bong-kyu : Human Theater& gt;  presents the works of Kang Bong-Kyu who has been documenting the scenes from historical political events lives of the people of the time or traditional feasts including rituals and exorcism. Instead of adopting an ethnographic approach or the history of photography the exhibition reflects on these lively portraits of human as human documentary speaking to the needs of the time inviting us to rethink the stance of the photographer as that of a producer or editor.  In Kang& #39;s photographs that share the course of modern history of Korea you can read the relationship of the society and the photographer as Bourdieu& #39;s Habitus. The dramatic modernization industrialization and globalization in the Korean society since the 1960s led the diversion of individuals and the society. While traditional spiritual culture was disappearing increased mass media kept relaying on fragmented images. There along the flow of the time Kang delivered records of the time traditional lives and the frank face of Koreans through the medias including newspaper magazine and publications. Kang& #39;s such human documentary pictures the public sphere through the records of individual lives. Conveying personal and public messages in the images they influenced the formation of social culture. Also as a photographer that communicated with the public and led the discourse by editing and publishing his own works Kang& #39;s attitude as a photographer is significant especially from the perspectives of the present time that all phenomena are delivered understood and remembered through media or signs.  Thus the exhibition was organized in three sections. To start with 1. Picturing the Common Human Theater is placed in Project Gallery 1. Works from newspapers magazines and publications since the 1960s are presented under categories & #39;Live Documentation of the Contemporary & #39; & #39;Stories of Our People& #39; and & #39;Regional Style and Spirit.& #39; Vivid records of the scene from April Revolution people& #39;s story in the faces of Koreans with the deep furrows of time and the last moments of the tradition kept by Namwon Dotongri people who later moved to Chenghak-dong. Capturing crucial moments of ordinary people works invite audiences to actively and deeply engage with the story of these human documentaries intervened by the interaction with the subject. Also details that unknowingly show up make a profound impression like Roland Barthes& #39; punctum while tradition that has been disappearing stirs up nostalgia.  2. Delivering the Origin of the Images: Generational Memories in Project Gallery 2 presents works that display the sprit of Korea. From local rituals of Jeollanam-do such as street rituals or exorcism to lyrical landscapes of Korea the works contain the image of home that a generation shared and the original image of & #39;typical Korea& #39; is being conveyed to the next generation through various media.  Lastly in 3. Photographer as the Producer and Editor visitors can see an archive of magazines and pictorials he published and cameras he used along with moving images of other works. Audiences can see how the works in the exhibition were actually shown in magazines and pictorials. Looking into Kang& #39;s oeuvre through the exhibition his works tend to cover subjects that could be easily objectified such as regions public individuals and traditional styles. Yet the reason why these topics did not merely become an interesting subject to see was because of the photographer& #39;s attitude that treats them as & #39;something we should not lose& #39; while identifying the subject and himself. His human documentary pictures the ordinary people for the ordinary people with a warm heart. Then again these works become a mirror that reflects the Korean society allowing us to envision the social context of the time outside the works.  We hope the exhibition could be an opportunity where you can enjoy the pleasure of the drama in this human theater that reflects various stories of people and read the time and the attitude of the photographer within Korean context.    1.  Picturing the Common Human Theater - Live Documentation of the Contemporary  Presented works in this section capture historic and political events as well as the lives of the people from the 1960s to the early 1980s. Kang Bong Kyu was greatly influenced by meeting Lee Kyoung Mo  at Honam Daily in 1959 who was known for his emblematic reportage works. Then Kang also served as a reporter and director of photography department at Jeonnam Daily. Photographs selected and distributed through newspapers were empowered and functioned as & #39;official memories.& #39; Being onsite Kang participated in not just as a simple observer but as a member of the society. Dynamically and vividly documenting crucial moments of ordinary people Kang delivers the & #39;heart of the people& #39; that goes beyond the & #39;official memories.& #39;  1. Picturing the Common Human Theater - Stories of Our People Presented works in this section focus on th lives of individuals which is a thematic approach he pursued from the 1960s to the 2000s. Through & #39;pictures of faces& #39; combined with stories that could be seen in & #39;100 People& #39; from the magazine Jeonil-graph issued in the 1970s magazine Lives of Our People that presented faces of Koreans and Time That Never Stopped which captured the elderly of an outback town Kang relays an image that is much more dramatic than the story. While he was influenced by life realism Kang also studied the essential part of humans such as faces with the traces of time and their changes according to regional environment. Different from modern photo-portraits these human documentary displayed with key objects are images that allow the intervention of the interaction between the photographer and the subject inviting audiences to actively engage with the story.  1. Picturing the Common Human Theater - Regional Style and Spirit  Works from the 1960s to the 1990s presented here exhibit the traditional life style that has been disappearing. In Korean society during modernization industrialization and globalization individuals and society became separated under the dual system of the traditional spiritual culture and materialistic structuralization of the society. Tradition to the detached individual meant stability home and the nostalgia for those that are dying. Display of works adopt various compositions bringing about integrity within itself. It also represents the tradition which was more recognized as something & #39;behind& #39; and thus & #39;needed to be developed& #40;through New Town Movement for example& #41;& #39; as an essential image of Koreans through pictorial publications such as Hometown of Koreans and Face of Koreans.  2. Delivering the Origin of the Images: Generational Memories  Works in this section present the harmony of traditional festivals including street rituals and exorcism the people and the nature. These lyrical and typical Korean images that demonstrate the spirit of Koreans are those that were shared by the generation that lived the same time and are now conveyed to the next generation through the media in a broader sense.    3. Photographer as the Producer and Editor  Archive including magazines and pictorial publications published by Kang and cameras that he used along with screenings of works& #40;from 1960s to 2000s& #41; that are not displayed.  The photographer& #39;s attitude is an element that needs to be put into consideration especially at a time when phenomena are delivered understood and remembered via certain media and symbols. As an editor and director of human documentaries since the 1960s which were addressed to the public through the media in a broad sense including newspapers magazines and other publications Kang has been the producer and messenger of memory and discourse.

For the third of the representative annual exhibition series by the Buk Seoul Museum of Art 2016 Title Match invites Ju Jae Hwan (1941~) who voices with his own unique humor while transcending various media and genres and Kim Dong Kyu (1978~) who reflects keen insights in his works by concentrating on products from contemporary society that are rapidly consumed and discarded.  With the subtitle 'starry violence dark starlight' the exhibition draws artistic conversations across all ages and times with the subject of 'violence' that prevails in our society. By observing the ways in which the two artists understand and interpret this pan-generational theme the exhibition attempts to observe the possibility of solidarity and reconciliation between generations despite their differences.  Consisting of newly produced works under the shared theme of ‘violence’ the exhibition unfolds an interesting contrast of works that reflect different perspectives and attitudes like the gap between the two artists from different generations. While the established artist Ju Jae Hwan focuses on forms of macro violence (like the never-ending wars terror and conflict on earth since the beginning of history) the artist from the next generation Kim Dong Kyu focuses on forms of micro violence that permeate the everyday landscape. .    Ju Jae Hwan reveals a reality where the power of life is overshadowed by the power of death where human life is taken lightly and people are killed by armed conflict. Composed of objects and images symbolizing conflicts and casualties documentation of the recent practice of disarmament and peace organizations and cartoons from a Palestinian editorial cartoonist Ju’s new works speak to our reflection and introspection towards a reality where we become indifferent to an ever-intensifying violence.    Kim Dong Kyu has persistently focused and explored the inherent meanings of the products of contemporary society that rapidly lose their utility and are discarded. In this exhibition he reveals an everyday violence that becomes the environment of our society ? a violence that becomes unrecognizable through works that include installations videos and drawings that employ the online medium advertising inflatables national flags and school mottos hung on walls and letters of apology.   Although belonging to different generations the two artists’ works are completed as a collaborative process that contests and harmonizes within the space. Their attitude and ways of developing works about the themes of violence expose their inherent dispositions as well as reflect characteristics from their own generations. Furthermore the exhibition expresses the current state of our society ― where different generations live together. Through this exhibition where the viewer can observe an everyday violence (ubiquitous parts of our lives which become almost invisible) alongside the tremendous scale of violence (like in war) we wish to provide an opportunity for viewers to recognize the omnipresent violence all around us.

As part of the locally based project of the 5 districts of northeastern Seoul where the Buk-Seoul Museum of Art belongs the exhibition showcases a project carried out in the form of a workshop by inviting graduate students from local art schools. For this project each school organizes a class or a sort of task force (TF) with a mentor; each team chooses one of five Gu (district) investigates the region and produces a collaborative work based on the research. The participating teams had a series of meetings with museum staffs art critics as well as residents and other people concerned and refined their work through workshops and a mentoring process.  The exhibition’s subtitle ‘Neighbors and Strangers’ focuses on the fact that although the 5 districts in northeastern Seoul are the bases of life and a foundation for living the regions are still very unknown and unfamiliar spaces and milieus to the articipating museums members of the schools and the audience. This implies a current state where there is a gap between museum local residents and audiences. There are also various views that intermingle originating from the different stances―or the lack (or limits) of communication between various subjects. The participating six teams discovered and examined these current issues and problems within the given areas of northeast Seoul―especially in Nowon-gu Dobonggu and Seongbuk-gu― and visualized their research with various attitudes and methods based on their different interpretations of community art. Each practice is the visual outcome of a process-oriented production that emphasizes building relationships with local residents and collaboration throughout the entire process―from planning to selecting the region finding subject matter and producing work.   Beginning before the opening of the exhibition most of the works on view will be completed or expanded through communication with residents and furthered through their participation and engagement during the exhibition period. Through this process each work provides an opportunity to find an undiscovered communal sensibility hidden behind the systems of society as well as discovering disregarded and overlooked local issues. The exhibition is also meaningful as an opportunity to see through the perspectives of young prospective artists the status quo of community art that can be interpreted differently depending on one’s stance which can also sometimes be felt as ambiguous. In collaboration with neighboring art colleges professors and graduate students SeMA Buk-Seoul Museum of Art’s Excavation project with northeastern art colleges: Neighbors and Strangers is the first attempt to overcome the limits of communication between various subjectivities in local communities. It will also find its significance in discovering promising emerging artists.","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192846_4231a88cc7cd4506ac02d629175fba9e_7b8fb59c787d4fcab2c347da5a49dd6c"

The artists included in this exhibition undergo much contemplation questions and process until reaching ‘something’ they want to deliver. This process is similar as the mumbling of an endless series of adjectives. This exhibition does not function to deliver perfect meaning but works as a rite of passage and a record of the waves that fluctuate inside artists who break thick layers.  The exhibition title employs both “shy” and “shameful” signifying the shyness of revealing something unfinished in its raw state as well as the conditioning of the external environment that might cause one to feel shame. The artists are consistently injected with education and cultural programing that produces standards making one feel shame when revealing embarrassing parts or the process as it is. Moreover the social system that requires one to recite overly perfected sentences forces the artist to produce something that does not sway from its legitimized status. The beginning point of <Shy/Shameful Trivial/Trifling> is to completely reveal the trivial process of thinking that is usually regarded as unnecessary to expose. Here some artists have more interest in the process of producing artworks and other artists focus on the process of retracing the history of the artwork from a diachronic perspective.  In this exhibition Youngju KWON displays drawings and notes which serve as the foundation and record for his works over the past 8 years. He has freely written sentences or words full of bluff and errors and embarrassing expressions resulting in a concentration of a lively and raw energy. Retracing these shameful and trivial traces that were never shown before the artist himself matures while hinting to the spectators what he is up to next.  Dorothy M Yoon who works in various media with an interest in the boundary condition deeply divided exhibits a digital collage work titled ‘Honey.’ The digital image is hard to read because it is covered with a mosaic like glass causing important parts to be cut out. This double haze leads spectators to infer trivial and personal stories from the image.  Yusam Sung displays various old and current works in the space that is set up like a studio. The works from the past include projects that were not presented to the public with the numerous drawings made for the project. In this exhibition he explores how old and current works are related tracing the process of the works’ transformation and how it can be the motivation to better understand current works and new processes.  Ji Hye Yeom who has great interests in specific places represents ‘Earth Tunnel Project’ a work she produced in 2010 but decided not to display because she herself measured it had failed and ‘Untitled Project’ a newly produced work for this exhibition. Through these two works the artist contemplates the meaning of project that implies ‘protrusion’ and ‘reflection’ along signifiers like ‘curation’ and ‘task’ and explores to the possibilities of a perfect deliberation of meaning in the works.  Taewon Heo exhibits ‘Untitled’ (Palm Lines Painting 2014) a work that reflects on the artist’s personal hopes of feeling an existence through the production process and ‘Laundry’(2008 - present) which reveals an individual life through the records of lethargic and incomplete days. Because the artist was taught that it was shameful to open up a personal narrative in her own works the artist presents personal works in a serious manner which were rejected in final evaluation and exhibition) that might be meaningful only for the artist.  Seunghee Hong continues ‘Force to Depth’ since 2007 a work that expresses the meaning of life and its weight using wrinkles to express this depth. In that space wrinkles and their significations express the matter’s gravity which was forcefully taken away with intuitive thinking. The drawing series for the exhibition embeds the artist’s personal sense and views as necessary products for completed works along with the records of various experimental attempts.  For the past few months these six artists have gone on a journey to find something of their own and have spent much time together sharing their trivial and frank stories. During the process some artists embarked towards something more concrete while others are still struggling to find that something. At the moment of writing this text I am not sure how <Shy/Shameful Trivial/Trifling> will turn out and how it will appear to spectators (this might just be the uncertainty of an artist who suddenly decides to curate). But the one thing that is clear is that it will be a platform that inevitably captures the process of each artist who breaks away from their box and creates their own narrative.

She established her own world of artworks with her unique figurative style at a time in the modern Korean art scene that was dominated by abstract art. On August 6 2015 she eternally passed away to the unknown world that constantly appears in her works.       Wishing that her works were preserved all together to present to the audience forever in 1998 the artist donated 93 major works which she treasured like her alter ego as well as the copyright to all the works to the Seoul Metropolitan Government. Memorial Exhibition of Chun Kyung-ja (1924 ~ 2015) : The Wind May Blow It Blows Anyway is prepared in honor of the artist’s achievements at the 1st anniversary of her death. The exhibition displays all of her donated works in addition to works from private collections and the artist’s archives including writings photos news articles illustrations and video. The subtitle of the exhibition is cited from the artist’s book Liberal Woman (Jiphyeonjeon 1979) : “The wind may blow. It blows anyway. We do not know where the wind comes from and where it goes. A life might be floating on that wind.” These words intend to share the artist’s unique poetic sensibility?one who has encountered joys and sorrows of a life ingenuously every moment.       The exhibition is constituted in 4 sections: Life Journey Fantasy and Archive. The ‘Life’ section exhibits Chun Kyung-ja’s iconic self-portraits and images of women including 'Solitude' (1974) 'The 22nd Page of My Sad Legend' (1977) and 'Since It Has Closed' (1989) with her student works at the Women’s College of Fine Arts in Tokyo and 'Life Form' (1951) which was painted to endure the period of social and personal confusion after the Korean War. In the ‘Journey’ section artworks labeled as ‘Travel Paintings’ during the 1970s to the 1980s are presented. Most of those works are highly dense landscape paintings and sketches that are based on inspiration from her travels in different countries including Africa Europe South America India and the United States. They manifest different aspects of Chun Kyung-ja an artist who is usually known to depict the major subject matter of flowers and women. Lastly the ‘Fantasy’ section presents her manifestation of an unknown world and the afterlife which she imagined. In this section exhibited works from the 1960s made with dreamlike colors and strong brush strokes include works such as 'Invocation of the Spirit of the Dead' (1965) 'White Night' (1966) as well as the unfinished work 'Fantasy Journey' (1955). Particularly in 'Fantasy Journey' (1955) spectators might observe the artist’s intense process of her works in repeatedly erasing and painting over.       Chun Kyung-ja once mentioned that she liked the phrase “life of incompleteness” implying this progressive condition because dreams disappear when reaching their completion. Through this exhibition we expect the audience to find the opportunity to confront challenge and healing by encountering the dreams and fantasies which she pursued without stop and her creative will to paint original works all the time even in moments of suffering.

By exploring their own themes and methods the participating artists try to present painting and its contexts while using the metaphor of theater and its elements of stage actor/actress audience facility and time.  In this exhibition PARK Yoon Kyung emphasizes the subjectivity of work audience and space like an actor or actress under the lights as she installs paintings with transparent surfaces that reflect its site being placed away from wall. Employing the metaphor of a theater’s behind the scenes Bae Yoon Hwan constructs a fictional artist and company for the transportation of fine art. Bae reveals what an artist can do besides creating an artwork and what occurs outside the visible exhibition space. Using the spatial characteristics of the exhibition space (its circular shape) Fay Shin rhythmically arranges a series of her small paintings on a sort of ladder which rose to a giddy height. In this way she directs the scene to actively engage with the audience’s gaze and their perception. Hyunjeong Lim creates a painting of a surreal scene with images that originate from the artist’s experience recollection imagination and subconscious. Lim suggests that the audience reinterpret the paintings with their own experiences and imagination. Heo Suyoung paints the collected sceneries of different times and spaces into a single picture plane creating an image like a film where time is condensed. Taewon Heo presents found painting images on the street in the exhibition space. By juxtaposing the context of an inside and outside ‘theater’ the artist poses questions on painting.  As they form their own unique visual vocabularies these six artists display particular scenes with various approaches. We expect the exhibition to change the way people appreciate a painting to perceive them in different ways towards an expanded notion in the process of crossing between the stage and the seating area for audience in and out of the image.■Heo Suyoung ","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192846_e95a8da011a340cf831a7dbf1daf2eef_944c99befd7a4398a954804fec6d8616"

The exhibition sheds new lights on ‘Minjung Art'  which was an avant-garde art movement in the period of socio-political transformation of the 1980s based on themes timely to the contemporary society we are living in. Also focusing on the works of contemporary artists that try experiments that are aesthetic but also social and carry messages of resistance the exhibition also looks into the avant-garde attitude that passes through generations.  Presenting the historic works of Minjung Art that autonomously emerged under the socio-political circumstances of Korea in the 1980s along with the new trend found in the works of the group of artists who concern the epistemology and ontology of art with social consciousness since the 1990s. The exhibition provides understanding of what the title names “Art in Society” which includes art of life participatory art communicative art resistant art and political art.  As much as the age and generation of the artists or media and forms they take differ the works resented in the exhibition aries considerably. Yet at a closer look heir works imply a bond of sympathy that hrough social intervention critical utterance and alternative suggestions art can play a role in seeking universal coexistence.

"000285","Lee JuYong Photographic Studio","","Buk Seoul Museum of Art Project Gallery 1-2","2016-05-03","2016-08-15","","","","","","","","","","In a time when we are indifferent to the production and consumption of images Buk Seoul Museum of Art presents Lee JuYong Photographic Studio an exhibition that represents the gradually disappearing photographic studio in the museum space. Collecting thousands of photographs and cameras over the past 30 years Lee JuYong considers early photographs as a record of society and culture of the time. He has carried out an archiving project that systematically categorizes the images. Through Lee JuYong’s photography practice that explores time history memory and identity based on the archive the exhibition attempts to communicate the meaning of portrait photography as an important image since the modern era and tell stories of the people in the photographs.   Following the invention of photography portrait photography enabled people of every class to possess their own portraits which was once the exclusive property of the privileged class. In Korea portrait photography was popularized in the early 1900s as photo studios emerged in the Joseon Dynasty. Taking the early photography studio as a motif the Cheonyoundang Photographic Studio Art Project is an actual photo studio built in project gallery 1 and serves as a space for taking portrait photographs. Lee JuYong Photographic Studio also consists of People on the Road ― portrait photographs produced using early studio photography techniques ― in project gallery 2.  The Cheonyoundang Photographic Studio Art Project is a participatory documentation project of portrait photography based on the Cheonyoundang Photographic Studio an important photography studio in Korean photography history. A studio run by Koreans the Cheonyoundang Photographic Studio strove to spread and popularize photography since it opened in 1907. Centering on the portrait photography studio for audiences’ voluntary participation the project consists of early portrait photographs and portraits from modern times in Korea China and Japan selected from Lee’s archive. Lee’s recent work Memory of the Moment (2015) employs early photographic process. The Portrait Documentation Project will be undertaken by the artist with a specific group of people during the exhibition period.   As a backdrop for the photography studio Lee placed a piece by Rhaomi Painting featuring pleasure-seeking moments(2016) which visualizes the universal hopes of human beings such as wealth and honor power and the flourishing of one’s decedents. Juxtaposing various props in front of the backdrop Lee represents the archetype of the modern photography studio from today’s perspective. Leading us to a fantasy world where the past and present coexist Lee JuYong’s photography studio enables the audience to experience monumental moments in our banal routine and voluntarily records the special moments in our lives. Capturing a moment of a subject and fixing it on photographic paper portrait photography might be a product of human desire as evident in portrait photographs from early photography history and in those from modern Korea China and Japan. These photographs might be a projection of early photographers’ wish to bring the practice of painting into photography and exhibit people’s desire to show their existence and impose the eternal into existence. In this sense Lee’s photography studio represents the here and now and serves as a space for realizing the desires of its visitors while escaping from reality.        Lee’s Memory of the Moment series captures objects and spaces using early photographic processes of ambrotype and tintype. The series is suggestive of the activities of the Cheonyoundang Photographic Studio Art Project which records the present moment in the form of the past. Additionally early portrait photographs and portraits from modern Korea China and Japan recuperate the traces and memories of people in modern times when they lived in the mixed influences of the three countries. Through these images of the past the audience experiences the past and the memory of the time. In the mixed time and space spanning from early photography to the present the Cheonyoundang Photographic Studio Art Project talks about the history of human life including our contemporaries by bringing the past and its memory into the present.   Lee JuYong has mainly taken photographs of objects using early photographic processes that require extended periods of time and serious concentration. These works were attempts to find the inherent essence and archetype of objects rather than their appearance. Lee’s focus switched from objects to humans in People on the Road a series of 21 photographs of sanitation workers produced through ‘Portraits Project of Public Service Workers of Seoul’ with the support of the Seoul Museum of Art and the Seoul Metropolitan Government Employees’ Union. Lee took portraits of people in the same occupation using traditional early studio photography techniques and attempted to extract each person’s individuality and project their interiority as well as appearance onto the image.    This exhibition is a significant turning point both in content and form in Lee JuYoung’s work. The Cheonyoundang Photographic Studio Art Project is presented as an open space that is completed by the participation of the audience. Taking a step further from People on the Road the artist conducts a project that records the portrait of citizens born before 1932 who lived through modern and contemporary Korea. Lee’s new attempt is very meaningful in that he is beginning to create a social document of our contemporaries beyond the recording of our past history. Through the exhibition LeeJuYong Photographic Studio held in the Buk Seoul Museum of Art we hope to offer an opportunity to appreciate the power of images as revealed in portrait photographs and recognize the stories of the people represented in the images.

There are many plants with different colors and textures mixed together exuding a unique scent.    The artists each in their own way are coming together to Nanji Park which was artificially constructed. Using the metaphor of ‘air plants’ ? which do not root in soil and can shift so they grow independently by drawing moisture and nutrients from the air this exhibition tries to present the position and situation of the artists in the residency who grow move and construct their own realm spontaneously.   At the early stage of the curatorial process which all of the resident artists participated the harmony of the images was considered an important factor in selecting the work. The process was similar to the garden design to emphasize natural elements such as water stone air light and plant. When talking to the artists at the first meeting there were a few awkward moments and some artists had a different idea in mind however that was all right. The artists became close to each other through the course of this difficult journey of the one-year residency and it is meaningful to share the discoveries for the future. The work that will be created in the garden ? the exhibition space of Nanji Studio - will affect each other in unexpected ways much like the process of air plants invisibly drawing moisture and nutrients from the air.

Selected from the collections of two globally recognized institutions the Centre national des arts plastiques(CNAP) and Fonds r?gional d’art contemporain Aquitaine (Frac Aquitaine) the exhibition presents 210 contemporary photographs taken after the 1950s.  The Family of the Invisibles commemorates the 100th anniversary of the birth of the French philosopher Roland Barthes (1915-1980). The exhibition has its anchor in the theory of photography in Camera Lucida an iconic book written by Barthes which had a significant influence on photography contemporary art cultural discourse and epistemology. Based on Barthes’ idea which paid attention to invisible and marginalized beings the exhibition criticizes the notion of an imaginary community of mankind which was previously presented in The Family of Man held at the MoMA in 1955. The exhibition also deconstructs mythical elements embedded in contemporary society.   The Family of the Invisibles will be hosted at SeMA and Ilwoo Space; the latter is affiliated with the Hanjin Business Group. The exhibition at Ilwoo Space presents black and white photographs taken in the 1950s which will be the prologue to SeMA’s exhibition presenting contemporary photographs taken after the 1970s. By presenting the exhibition in two institutions spectators would be able to explore the interesting intersection between Barthes’ theory and contemporary photographs as well as grasp the meaning of the photo collections of Cnap and Frac Aquitaine.

Borrowing this concept we titled SeMA NANJI 9th Review as <Experiment & Expression (九思九容)> by substituting the original meaning of mental attitude in ‘九思’ with experimental attitude of artists and demeanor in ‘九容’ with artistic expression. Thus <Experiment & Expression (九思九容)> implies that the 9th term artists of SeMA NANJI RESIDENCY deeply contemplated explored and repeated numerous experiments which are expressed through their works’ complexity. Also the number ‘9’ in Asian culture is regarded as the fullest number to express in this life. In fact the number 9 character in Chinese writing (九) is pronounced the same as 具 (to possess). It also implies perfection which we intended to reflect in the exhibition title. Thus ‘九思九容’ in the exhibition title means the perfect works of the artist as well as that it is the 9th outcomes of SeMA NANJI RESIDENCY  after our journey with them.  SeMA NANJI RESIDENCY is the residency program operated by Seoul Museum of Art. It is the creative space where young artists reside and produce artworks as well as being an active field within the art world where diverse artistic experiments research exhibitions and exchanges take place. Inaugurated in 2006 SeMA NANJI RESIDENCY has undergone many changes and improvements which culminates in today’s 9th program. It is now able to provide the resident artists a more systematic program. Among the programs the ‘NANJI ART SHOW’ is an exhibition the resident artists plan and operate by themselves by sharing their field of interest. They collaborate based on various topics and create exhibitions in new formats. Also during the research program ‘Art Critic Workshop’ the artists discuss their work from diverse perspectives with critics and participate in producing a creative theory of their work. Through this process the artists may improve their work with more depth in terms of content and expression.  Artists reason through sensuous thinking or intuitive sensibility rather than logical thinking. At the same time such a way of reasoning is linked and processed through various experiments while engaged in studies or experimentation. After repeating actualizing and abstracting the studies when the artist feels that it is done the work is presented to the world as one expression. When comparing such experiments and expressions of the artists to ‘九思’ and ‘九容’ for 9th term artists the phrase ‘九思’ is their nine topics: reality society daily life art ideology experience emotion generation and tradition while the phrase ‘九容’ is the result of the nine expressions on that topics. The expressions may reveal the significance of invisible spaces reflect on the issue of social participation assign authentic meaning to objects in daily life crush stereotypes through recycling expand the domain of art by suggesting new ways of drawing or applying craft skills express relations formed in multilayers and utilize new mediums of the current era such as digital technology sound or light.   <Experiment & Expression (九思九容)> is the survey of the outcomes of the past year in which the 21 artists of the 9th term of SeMA NANJI RESIDENCY have worked on. Through the exhibition we are able to feel and appreciate their experimental spirit and expressive will.

From the past until the present this exhibition traces the history of the former Belgian Consulate. Built during the Daehan Empire era it is now used as the SeMA Nam-Seoul Living Arts Museum.  This year has a great significance because the building marks its 110th anniversary. In 2004 the former Belgian Consulate was remodeled as the Nam Seoul Annex Building of SeMA and was mostly used as white cube spaces. After the building was programmed into a living arts museum it has undergone restoration work. Through this work visitors can come to appreciate the original architectural features of the building.     Evolved Museum: the former Belgian Consulate consists of two sections: An architectural section that analyzes the building’s history and character and an art section that offers a reinterpretation of the building and its surrounding environment by artists. Based on serious research and study a historian of Korean modern architecture Ahn Changmo organizes the architectural section as a guest curator. Through the exhibition and a symposium the achievement of these efforts summons the unknown past into the present. Additionally as the architectural firm ONE O ONE FACTORY and Ko Joohwan have participated in the restoration of the cultural property the exhibition contains collaborations between the field of history architecture and cultural property.    Meanwhile Sangdon Kim Noh Sangho IM Heung-soon Chang Hwa-jin Shan Hur and SSAV group participate in the art section. Through various genres including painting sculpture video photography and installation from today’s perspective and by extending the topography to surrounding areas such as Sadang and Namhyeon-dong the artists activate the multi-layered meanings of the building across its history culture and society.  Evolved Museum: the former Belgian Consulate will provide a unique opportunity to encounter the historic value of the unknown Belgian Consulate as well as its current significance as a museum.

Embracing not only pure art but also the related fields of architecture film design etc. and espousing the value of multimedia post-genreism and convergence in contemporary art following the Tim Burton Exhibition in 2012 SeMA has the opportunity to present the world of Stanley Kubrick's works to the Korean public.  Stanley Kubrick is one of the most influential directors in film history famous for his innovative cinematography. 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) now regarded as a benchmark for special effects shows strikingly realistic visuals so much so that it is hard to believe that the film was produced before the first moon landing. With ceaseless experimentation challenges and ground-breaking ideas Kubrick produced films like A Clockwork Orange (1971) Barry Lyndon (1975) The Shining (1980) Full Metal Jacket (1987) and Eyes Wide Shut (1999) that remain as crucial films in cinema history.  To further immerse viewers in the world of Stanley Kubrick this exhibition enriches the narratives on a spectacular scale and with formative stagecraft has blurred the lines between cinematic and visual art. As he considered music to be a significant cinematic device soundtracks will be played in the exhibition halls to preserve Kubrick's intent and allow the audience to actually “feel” his masterpieces. In addtion over a thousand items from the archives are on display such as research materials photographs scripts letters film props costumes cameras and lenses left by the director during his lifetime of film production. Through the precious resources which display the perfectionist process of his production one can see the profound world and diligence that Kubrick pursued as an artist so massively influential in the field of visual art.  After its first opening in Frankfurt Germany in 2004 the Stanley Kubrick Exhibition has been widely acclaimed during its tour in cities all over the world. As the first to host the exhibition in Asia SeMA hopes to inspire creativity and a spirit of adventure and to further provide a unique artistic experience into the world of Stanley Kubrick not only to children and adolescents but to general public and experts as well. We greatly appreciate the contributions of Deutsches Filmmuseum Hyundai Card and GNC Media for their cooperation in realizing the exhibition and we thank you the public for your interest and support.","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192845_8d00ce3f4f4848b5a97743a5748f9fd8_86cb46f549d547478b83bbea603d6819"

Freedom also exists along with several conditions that limit it. A certain degree of freedom is given to us and it may vary depending on our circumstances.  Some admiration for a vague field of activity called art is often connected to the possibility of the customary enjoyment of art within a given degree of freedom.  By the way are artists and art as free as all that?   The various circumstances facing each society and individual also limit each individual artist in several aspects and define a form. By doing so they force artists to conform to the formation. The diversity of art creation of each individual artist may be affected by the degree of limitation imposed on both the internal and external circumstances to which each artist responds.  The conditions of each individual's private life social circumstances and required or voluntary regulations art trends and the roles of intricate power…  Different prohibitions and limitations in our contemporary time form a group of artists and create a flow in the art field.  The dogmas which dictate what can or cannot be done or what is dangerous or what does not have any vision--the source of all these limitations varies and numerous.   by the way Even though such circumstantial contexts and relative conditions work and even if the power of canceling and removing is endlessly imposing if we need to do something or if we want to do it if there are some unkillable fragments should be done heard or seen--what would that mean for each of us who is living now?

With the theme of ‘unused space’ that has recently been a main issue with the urban regeneration policy SeMA presents Re-Play: 4 Platforms & 17 Events an experimental project that revitalizes ‘unused space’ into cultural spaces in local hubs.  The concept of ‘urban regeneration’ which came from the West since the 1980s includes revitalizing post-industrial city through cultural activities and urban cultural policies established to improve the image of underdeveloped city. Since the 2000s Korea also began to revitalize grafting unused facilities through culture with the idea of ‘Creative City.’ However in the process of urban regeneration using old and empty buildings it was evident that these projects lacked consideration for its users and the local communities. Also it can be pointed that the studies for cultural programs and content to induce user’s active participation were also insufficient. It is necessary to prepare museum programs and activities to help the audience and local communities to participate and become the main agent of the cultural activities.  This exhibition is a stage to explore cultural spaces where the audience becomes both the agent and object of cultural activities experimenting in the possibility of their functions. For this four architects/teams NAMELESS Architecture (Unchung Na Sorae Yoo) Park Cheon Kang x NamIl Joe Tchely Hyung-Chul SHIN @ shinslab Keehyun Ahn + Minjae Shin (AnLstudio) propose four platforms that employ the architectural imagination to revitalize (Re-play) temporarily dormant spaces. Artist Soyoung CHUNG approaches the idea of suspended time and the possible dynamism of unused space through her unique formal language. Additionally 17 events including workshops lectures screenings and mentoring at 4 platforms during the exhibition anticipates the experimentation that the vision of SeMA aims for as well as becoming a playground for creating and learning by providing a place for participation.

That being the case one may ask the following questions: Who is telling the truth? What is the truth of the incident which is ultimately deferred to the end of the movie? How can we prove facts without lies? Does truth exist or is it fabricated? If the truth I believe in is fabricated by someone or something else rather than existing as a real subject what really constitutes the truth? There are five different main characters. Each of them remembers “the incident of that time” differently. Today they will recount to us their memories of that incident. How close will their stories be to the “incident of that time”? The truth of an incident as we believe it to be truthful might be the outcome of an extremely subjective mode of recognition by which each person understands and judges the truth. In the end we cannot reach one completely agreed upon truth. Facts are always covered with a veil and as soon as we attempt to prove their veracity the structure of our cognition becomes unstable just as it has always been. Taking five facts and five reconstructions of the facts I endeavor to trace the perceptive method that we use in accepting and judging truth. Through the method of recognizing and remembering incidents we experience as well as through the process of revealing them in a concrete something what do we choose to say and what do we try to say? Consequently to what extent is our reality distorted? Today the five truths in front of us could be five lies. Reality may be a virtual thing that has been composed by each person’s own cognitive system. How are we creating our own reality at the moment?

Perhaps the most conspicuous scenes of downtown life will be of people using their portable mobile devices such as Smartphones as they walk along sidewalks travel on the subway or dine in a restaurant. This exhibition titled ≪DigiFun Art: Urban Scape≫ aims to show how mobile devices and their various applications which have become more than essential to us also serve as a new artistic tool for artists; as well as to shed light on creative activities in new fields that have emerged through the various functions of smart devices.   The term ‘DigiFun’ in the title of the exhibition is a compound word made from ‘digital’ and ‘fun.’ Just as the contemporary British artist David Hockney has been creating and presenting a series of iPad drawings since 2009 portable mobile gadgets allow people to engage in creative activities without being limited by place or conventional tools such as brushes or water colors and fulfill the basic need for novelty and pleasure.   This exhibition can be divided into four sections. ●The first section consists of artworks by six contemporary artists (Kim yongkwan Yong-Chul Kim Park Gwang soo Fi Jae Lee Hong Kyoungtack Hong Seung-Hye) all of whom have chosen mobile digital devices as a new medium for this exhibition. The artists have created works in various genres including sound installations photo collages drawings sheet cuttings and sticker installations and produced videos using tablet PCs and various applications. ●The second section introduces works by Korean and overseas artists (Hongkyu Kim Seung Jun Ahn Jeremy Sutton Joanne Carter Susan Murtaugh J?rge Hinz) who are known as ‘mobile artists’ or ‘iPad artists’ working in a new field created by the development of applications and the functions of mobile devices. These artists create their works - including drawings and photos - using mobile devices while working in a different occupation and have expanded the field of digital creativity by forming a venue for discussion. ●The third section is a drawing experience space produced in cooperation with Yonsei Institute of Convergence Technology which allows all visitors alike to participate in artwork. When visitors take photos and draw on the photos the work titled ‘Pixel Scape’ which combines digital technology with analogue drawings transforms the photos into pixel images and provides an interesting experience that changed simple actions into painting by stimulating the imagination. ●The last section exhibits artworks by thirty-three people who participated in a contest held to show that anyone can create art simply by using a mobile device. It aims to share the voices of various people who have created artworks such as ‘mobile drawings’.   In addition to the exhibition this event will offer visitors an opportunity to listen to the latest trends in mobile art activities that are being discussed overseas by inviting BBC journalist Joanne Carter who runs a website about mobile art and mobile photography as well as Jeremy Sutton who organizes live drawing performances and workshops at the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington DC USA and the Victoria & Albert Museum in London UK. We hope this event will allow visitors to familiarize themselves with various aspects of ‘Digital-fun’ that may be developing or which has already been established as a new trend.     - Exhibition & Lecture : Project Gallery 3F - Workshop on the 24th : B1 ","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192848_4a5bb62307354a0284b824d6a5c5546d_9db0a63b492447c887620db9581139dc"

It brings to light the memory of 200000 young women referred to as 'comfort women' who were systematically exploited as sex slaves in Asia during World War II and increases awareness of sexual violence against women during wartime.  The gathering of women to serve the Imperial Japanese Army was organized on an industrial scale not seen before in modern history. This project promotes awareness of these women some of whom are still alive today and brings to light a history which has been largely forgotten and denied.  Whenever there's a war we hear about the suffering of soldiers yet we hear almost nothing about the plight of women who are kidnaped and raped or killed. Often it is the poorest and most marginalized elements of society who suffer most. Through out history women like this are too often invisible forgotten and left with no place to turn.  Historian Suzanne O'Brien has written that  'the privileging of written documents works to exclude from history...the voices of the kind of people comfort women represent - the female the impoverished the colonized the illiterate and the racially and ethnically oppressed. These people have left few written records of their experiences and therefore are denied a place in history.'  The 'Comfort Women System' is considered the largest case of human trafficking in the 20th century. Much in the same way that acknowledgment and awareness of the Holocaust helps to insure it will not happen again by acknowledging this issue we can prevent another generation of enslaved 'comfort women' from happening anywhere ever again.  In the 21st century human trafficking has surpassed drug trafficking to become the second largest business in the world after arms dealing. The 'comfort women' issue illustrates the victimization which women suffer in terms of gender ethnicity politics and class oppression and how women are still perceived as a disposable commodity. This project promotes empowerment of these and all women and seeks to establish a path toward a future where oppression is no longer tolerated.  Despite growing awareness of the issue of trafficking of women and of sexual slavery as a crime against humanity this particular recent historical event has gone largely unacknowledged. It attempts to bring to light this instance of organized violence against women and to create a constructive dialogue for the future by acknowledging their place in history.","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192848_6edf927f75464be7ae5cb67d8567659a_1c1ca17d3dea427a9a8e6abcb9742062"

Within the debates on the intersection of globalization and localism and the issues of gender and reproduction in modern art discourse the art of Asian women has consistently been a subject of criticism due to its political implications in terms of geography and gender.  From a Western-centric and patriarchal perspective Asia and women both fall under the category of “invisible other.” This category is also the realm of fantasy in which charm and intimidation coexist at the border between reality and non-reality. Within this context this exhibition’s title (FANTasia) was derived as a compound word combining the terms “fantasy” and “Asia.”  Through the diverse works of 14 participating artists from various countries including Korea China Japan Singapore Thailand Indonesia and India visitors are provided the opportunity to heighten their understanding of feminism and learn about the current status of East Asian women’s art.","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192845_a8a45366e93b46f7a55df1a8162bbe83_fed43e6dfbf84d87b6013ca96e70bfae"

Marking its second year Title Match: gum nuri vs Hong Jungpyo invites gum nuri (1951~) who has served pioneering roles over various areas of art in the 20th Century Korean art world and Hong Jungpyo (1976~) a promising artist who has been attracting much attention in the 21st century.   Based on art’s sensitivity gum nuri has been prominent in all visual art fields ranging from experimental sculpture installation performance and publication. In particular leading into the second expansion of his avant-garde spirit and artistic soul was a revolutionary change in his perspective on art and attitude in mid to late 1990s ― this spirit still persists today.   Having grown up in the most contemporary environment Hong Jungpyo explores fundamental questions about contemporary art and art practices. He experiments between the boundaries of art and daily life representing the process with his refined artistic language. Consequently his works maximize a purely formal aesthetic and highlight its formal beauty. Although it plainly reveals the limit of art and artist it also presents a highly refined work containing the artist’s own unique order.   As the exhibition’s title suggests this exhibition presents ‘confronting’ artistic viewpoints and work attitudes of the two artists both who have careers in ‘sculpture’ working in various mediums such as 2D work sculpture installation and performance. These two artists choose materials and mediums of opposing characters and work in contrasting modes. As their works are displayed in one space subtle collisions and harmonies are formed.   After being selected the two artists have completed Title Match through continuous meetings and dialogue. Now we can sense the present state of contemporary art and foresee the future by comparing their works and witnessing the amusing reversal of generational gaps. The exhibition represents the artists just as they are as a young artist who asks “what is contemporary art?” and the old artist who freely and candidly answers his question.

Seoul Focus is SeMA’s annual art show that has brought specific aspects of contemporary art into the spotlight focusing on a particular medium and theme. This year’s exhibition focuses primarily on crafts and design showcasing living art in harmony with life itself.   A carnival of artworks born from the hands of nine participating artists blur and extend the borders of living art transcending genre and medium. Crafts produced through handiwork such as kneading weaving processing and applying paints to and with both traditional and modern materials like ceramics hanji steel and plastic have a practical use while synesthetically carrying aspects of modeling beauty. Design works such as lighting fixtures and furniture that have been filtered into our living space help to enrich our lifestyles through a reinterpretation of traditional motifs in a contemporary fashion experimenting with the fusion of materials. Living and craft items such as antique stoves and vintage items that an artist has collected reflect his preferences and inspire his work. At the exhibition viewers are able to go through an encounter between art and life where they will sense the delicate touch and eyes of the artists alongside the physical properties of diverse materials.  This exhibition is particularly meaningful in that it will showcase new pieces alongside remakes of the works exhibited at the Nam Seoul Living Arts Museum an art museum founded in 2012 that has dedicated itself to crafts and design. The art show provides viewers of the Buk Seoul Museum of Art a community-friendly public art complex with an opportunity to experience art closely associated with life and will expand the original function of the museum through the transregional linkage of the Buk Seoul Museum and the Nam Seoul Living Arts Museum.  Through Festival of Hands which promises to offer a new aesthetic inspiration and thrill we hope you will be able to fully enjoy living art in which function has been orchestrated with beauty.

It is significant because we need to put our heads together and discuss how we should represent imagine and connect North Korea as the very close but distant ‘other’ before it is too late.  NK Project is comprised of 3 sections: A representation of North Korea’s visual culture at-a-glance including oil paintings posters and stamps North Korea’s scenery and people depicted in the photographs of foreign artists and video and installation art by South Korean artists depicting the subject of North Korea. For the first time shown in South Korea are parts of a collection of North Korean oil paintings from Dutch collector Ronald de Groen posters from Dutch collector Willem van der Bijl and stamps from Korean collector Donghuyn Shin. In the past North Korean art shown in South Korea solely focused on Chos?nhwa (the traditional paintings of the Chosun era) this exhibition will be an opportunity to encounter diverse aspects of North Korean art seen through the broad spectrum of visual culture.  The exhibition introduces foreign photographers Nick Danziger from the U.K. Eddo Hartman from Netherlands and Wang Guofeng from China. Their photographs taken after 2010 which depict architecture of city landscape and people present current scenes of North Korea. Representing South Korean artists we have invited prominent figures who are well-known for producing North Korean themed works such as Ikjoong Kang Chankyung Park Suntag Noh Yongbeck Lee Sun Moo who has been active in South Korean art world as a North Korean defector and younger emerging artists Hayoon Kwon and Sojung Jun. Through these seven South Korean artists who combine their artistic imagination of North Korea with their sharp awareness of reality we expect the spectrum of the exhibition NK Project will be broadened.    Through NK Project’s three sections that include the vision of the artist perspectives of foreigner and visual culture of North Korea we try to suggest a mapping that three different views exchanges as if having a conversation with each other. Moreover we expect the audience in the exhibition space can feel these exchanges of views mix their own views with them and actively expand and explore the discourse and ideas.

Every human being inevitably faces death at some point. This is an undisputable fact. What is disputable however are the different perspectives on the definition of death. Death can be a visible termination of all beings’ biological functions. Conversely even though the biological functions of a human body may be terminated the spirit may still be alive. In this case termination of the spirit constitutes death. As such death can be interpreted or defined differently by each person. We live in a tangible material world are often worn out at the end of the day and are ultimately destined to die. This fate gives artists seemingly limitless inspiration to draw on. Fears of the end hopes for the afterlife and other themes related with death have always been common subject matter in the fields of art and philosophy. This exhibition shows a wide spectrum of perspectives on death in a variety of forms as artists interpret the end on their diverse artistic terms. It offers a rare look at diverse approaches to death through visual works that redefine death which is a non-visual subject.

As with most things in life some collections may begin out of impulse. Still things that are being repeated and are continuous tend to have their own unique reasons generating an order or a system. When a collector collects things he adds some meaning or value to them beyond the general and conventional value characteristics and meaning. As a result he forms his unique scope of collection and the criteria for classification. The materials that are being collected and classified in such manner may turn into a visual map that can represent a collector’s thinking assertion and sensibility.   2 Homunculus is a Latin word meaning “little man.” In neuroanatomy a visual representation of parts of the cerebral cortex which is responsible for the processing of motor information will take on the appearance of a homunculus with big head and big hands. The sensory homunculus depicts a big eye that covers the entire body but this does not necessarily reflect the amount of cerebral cortex devoted to the eyes. It seems that the appearance of a little man with big eyes and giant hands can be likened to artists who observe trivial things attentively with great effort collect things that mesmerize them and continuously create things based on their observations.  This exhibition was planned out of personal curiosity. As an artist when I see artworks by other artists I am mostly curious about what has made them create art and what has driven them to continue doing it. I find clues to these questions from materials or data from which the creation of an artwork began. An impulse to embody something comes from such original data and materials. The moment is a moment of curiosity and a moment of purely aesthetic impulse. As if a person’s soul and another person’s spirit confront each other a moment through which the mind of an artist and certain objects face off reflects a moment of potential when object A transforms into a totally different object B as in alchemy.   3 Artist KIM Eun Hyung attempts to reinterpret the music actions literature stage art and architecture - which are elements of a performance - in a modern way while appreciating an opera. He investigates several versions of the performance of one opera and collects various materials such as song books interviews with stage designers and drawings. Opera which is a collective art (Gesamtkunstwerk) becomes richer and varied by using the medium of the artist who is an appreciator of the performance. His drawing work which includes the artist’s appreciation in the present time and space and the content of opera encompass various interpretations of one performance from different perspectives. His sculptural drawings and wall drawing works give the impression of self-expansion as the images organically interconnect.  Artist NOH Sangho is a collector and a painter as well as a storyteller. He collects various photos of different uses from the Internet and draws on carbon paper by placing it on the collected photos. He discovers stories from his collections as if associating things with the stains on the walls or clouds.  His carbon paper drawings reflecting his imagination take on new images and stories that are totally different from those of the original. His drawings and stories resemble each other as they traverse each other. Several paintings are sometimes connected to form one story. The link connecting several photos from different sources is a mood that can be uniquely felt from his photos and it is his own imagination that is expressed through the medium of photos.  Artist U Juju often visits the supermarkets and museums of various countries numerous times to work on <The Super Museum Project>. After the exploration and investigations she creates folk works or artifacts that can be seen from the local museums by using the objects produced in the local area. Outcomes such as armor made of aluminum plates or dress made of paper napkin look like the most common materials and most typical objects yet they are unusual unfamiliar things. Based on the fact that the artifacts collected by museums also make things look different depending on the time and place and involve an external point of view her artwork can be considered a parody about the museums.   Artist LEE Boram collects journalism photos on wars or terrors. The collected photos are classified into the theme of Christianity according to the criteria for similarity in images. When the classified photos are changed to a painting the color brightness and victim-surrounding background of the original photos are removed. Consequently the victims on the painting are detached from concrete incidents becoming anonymous “victims” or victims who symbolize wars and tragedy or express them metaphorically. The process resembles a method wherein the image of the victims and the sensibility of viewers are consumed in the environment of today’s mass media.   Artist CHUNG Munkyung collects old clothes. Apparently the reason she collects old clothes not new ones is that what she collects is not clothes as an object but clothes as a reservoir of memories and recollections. As a result the objects she makes out of clothes resemble childhood play. The play is not at all pleasant or trivial however. She intentionally differentiates the inside and outside of clothes in her work. The clothes which function like skin above the skin or serve as a protective barrier or a boundary between the “self” and the outside world continuously remind viewers of the issues of individuals vs. groups.  Artist JU Sekyun’s <Tracing Drawing Series> begins from photos of museum porcelain collected from the Internet. Based on the collected photos the artist makes ceramics and draws patterns on the ceramics with a pencil. Due to errors produced in the process of changing 3-D objects to 2-D images the artist has to go through the process of “selection” and “concession.” Through such rearrangement new ceramics that are totally different from the actual ceramics or from those in photos are created. The process symbolizes regulations and customs accumulated within a community as well as the resulting life and anxiety. The discrepancy between a fixated social condition and the actual life resembles the white negative space of porcelain created in the process of rearrangement. Note however that the negative space is a positive space that connotes different possibilities.    4 The general value of materials is replaced with the meanings provided by collectors artists and homunculi and they are filled with imaginations. Actually the collections are like a mirror reflecting the collectors’ interest and fascination(LEE Boram).

As the title referring to an “unexpected meeting” suggests the art show exhibits artistic products that transcend our imagination lending new value to a variety of everyday things such as mass-produced household items fashion accessories disposable products abandoned goods food and natural objects.   Mundane trifling things chosen or found by the twenty-three artists attending the exhibition enter the realm of art becoming ingredients for their work exploring personal experience memories conceptual and philosophical thinking and whimsical imagination while also experimenting with the material itself. This exhibition consisting of two parts When material turns to content and When material turns to medium has been designed to examine how familiar abandoned or at times insignificant objects exist as works of art gaining new aesthetic value.   On exhibit in the section When material turns to content on the first floor are mainly large-scale installations using materials whose substantial qualities as familiar objects are maintained. The intrinsic attributes and values of things such as traces of time and memories accumulated in the objects and the way they are consumed in society motivate these works. The materials are used as a formative language to hold the artists’ intent. They play around the boundaries between art and non-art art and everyday life being transformed into innovative works of art through diverse methods of integration deconstruction combination modification and presentation.   On display in the section When material turns to medium on the second floor are works whose appearances seem familiar to us like paintings sculptures or crafts. The materials used for these pieces are not immediately recognized creating confusion in our perception. We are only able to grasp their true nature in the process of appreciating them leisurely with time. An exploration of their material properties culminates in these works. Materials found in accumulations of small units such as sequins beads grains plastic blocks and hair are used as mediums to generate spectacular optical illusions or create new forms through labor-intensive manual work.  This exhibition is intended to help stimulate interest in and an understanding of contemporary art and its use of materials serving as an opportunity to encourage communication between the audience and the museum. It is also hoped the art show will offer a chance to experience a visual wonder through encounters with everyday objects that have fortuitously been turned into whimsical artworks and have become a part of contemporary art that we can intimately enjoy.

","The horizon was completely right round. Beneath the broad cupola of the sky the enormous disc of the barren sea extended all around; but in that empty measureless space our sense of time also suffers and we daze in the disorienting shapelessness. Death in Venice (1912) by Thomas Mann  You must have gone to see the night sea on impulse at least once. Humans' unconscious desire to see the sea reflects a cathartic need. Similar to the introductory part of Thomas Mann's novel 「Death in Venice」 which is cited above this exhibition begins from an attempt to draw in a melting point and to experience a personal social feeling as one stares at plane scenery resembling an abstract color painting depicting the sky and the sea.   The Nanji Exhibition Halls are dome-shaped galleries; they used to be water-recycling tanks. As described in 「Death in Venice」 the dome-shaped gallery is a space that can create borderless scenery wherein a huge horizon crosses between the sky and sea assuming we are standing on the sea. It is because the circular space is surrounded by the same scenery in all directions.

The prints by Korean artists from 1980?90 are selected from the collection of SeMA displaying generational participatory arts of Korean artists following the previous K?the Kollwitz print exhibition.   This exhibition traces the artistic movement reflecting the spirits of Korean artists of the time and contemplates art as not being separate from life which was a new communication method of that time.   The photo gallery 1 exhibits prints published from early to mid?1980s by Oh Yoon (1946?1986) Min Joung-ki (1949?) and Hong Sung Dam (1955?). Those prints reflects historical affairs such as the Korean War (6?25 War) and the reality of a military dictatorship as well as the 5?18 Gwangju Democratic Uprising that was directly experienced by the artists when they were young intellectuals.   Photo gallery 2 displays prints published from the mid?1980s to early 1990s and by Kim Joon?Kwon (1956?) whose works address peasant movement leaders Park Bul Dong (1956?) whose works satirized the political and social reality of that time and Seon Wung Hong (1952?) whose works reflect his hope for reunification and democratization of Korea.   The new art movement led by the artists mentioned above significantly contributed to the establishment of today’s Korean contemporary art scene. When reflecting on the print art of the 80s?90s the significance of those artists is apparent particularly with regard to how they acknowledged and reflected reality into their works which was a first in Korean art; they elevated the topic and content addressed by their works; and they thereby helped Korean contemporary art obtain its identity.

The artist Kim Hee Soo presents a collection of audio products from the 1950s and 60s gathered with an idea of historical context of design. The artist Lee Ju Yong presents a collection of antique cameras and old photographs with a particular interest in memory and documenting.

Three artists’ different types of collections such as antique cameras antique audio and vintage furniture should be considered as a creative reference  that influences the artists indirectly more than the narcissistic objects that reflect the each artist’s taste. Moreover the exhibition can be meaningful in that aesthetic sympathy expands cultural historical implications when their collections are displayed in a public museum beyond the private realms.   Through the exhibition that demonstrates how the artist’s collecting is related to creating as well as the modern and contemporary lifestyles and tastes it intensifies the role of Nam Seoul Museum as a ‘living arts museum.’ Also audience will have a new experience by discovering the act of collecting that can be a creative process.

This exhibition co-organized by SeMA and the Korea Foundation is presented in relation to the Asia Colloquium: The Subtle Triangle which was held at SeMA in November 2014. Following academic discussions among directors and curators of private/public museums in East Asia as well as practitioners who work actively in the international art field the exhibition focuses on the artists; Yangachi (Korea) Xu Zhen (China) and Koizumi Meiro (Japan). The Subtle Triangle attempts to escape Western-oriented analyses of Northeast Asia as well as nationalism regionalism and culturalism focusing rather on the art world of the artists who are leading the upcoming generation. This exhibition will further examine the current state of Northeast Asia and thus propose change and development.   Yangachi Xu Zhen and Koizumi Meiro were all born in the 1970s. They not only lead the Asian art world but also actively participate in international exhibitions and art events. Yangachi presents his new production Sea Salt Theatre for the current exhibition. Sea Salt Theatre is an experiment within his recent interest in researching geographical elements and temporalities that are based within Asia. Yangachi aspires to greet and re-appropriate new audiences through his work. Koizumi Meiro from Japan is presenting a series of works that explores moments of human emotion and control. For The Subtle Triangle he reveals how the disappearance of historical facts are witnessed and reestablished thus presenting a critical perspective of distinct historical circumstances of Japan. Xu Zhen from China founded the MadeIn Company in 2009 and has continuously presented works that question the limits and meaning of art. Xu has recently been invited to exhibit at diverse international museums as well as Art Basel Miami and the Biennale de Lyon. Xu and Koizumi both present their large-scale works for the first time in Korea.   The Subtle Triangle also provides an archive lounge on the third floor which presents a history of cultural exchanges among Korea China and Japan since 1989 (when Korea and China initiated cultural exchange). The archive offers an opportunity to examine the sensitive and interesting sociopolitical history of the three countries alongside its art history. Additionally an education program co-organized by the education department of SeMA and the Trilateral Cooperation Secretariat will invite youth from Northeast Asia who live in Seoul to discuss and share ideas on the past present and future of the three countries based on the exhibition and historical records and further share their opinions on the potential paths the countries should take. Instead of observing one another with a contemplative attitude The Subtle Triangle strives to construct a new discourse on Northeast Asian contemporary art by materializing their topics and enthusiastically engaging one another through psychological expansion.","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192847_e10ca8ba8dab4a33b9059cf892a1762a_54ce02a5405d495db9b82501605ca48a"

Elephant  “What is seeing?”  Can an experience of touch smell sound or taste replace the idea of “seeing?”  What kind of relationships do seeing feeling and understanding the nature of a phenomenon and object form?  The exhibition Unfolding the Folds of Elephant explores the original and fundamental subject of “What is seeing.” This exhibition begins where different approaches and perspectives of the artist Oum Jeongsoon and the visually impaired meet about the same question they were asked. Oum works on the subject of the formation and destruction of infinite lines “the nature of presence” through its repetitive action and on the ideological essence of “seeing.” On the other hand works of art by the blind are produced by seeing through the heart as they physically trace things to visualize an idea - it is their ability to discern the whole from the part as they approach the nature of presence and the essence of seeing what is not seen through another kind of vision. These are the reasons that Elephant  WALK  by Oum and Touching An Elephant by the visually impaired are exhibited in the same space.  Nothing but the presence of an elephant has made this entire journey possible. As the artist Oum and the blind manifest the nature of seeing they seek the nature of existence and there is an elephant in the center.  Through the life of an individual elephant Through the historical event where an elephant plays an important role We look into the dynamic soul of a great species an elephant And we gain a deep insight into ourselves   Similar to what the ecology psychologist Dr. Bradshaw once mentioned in the encounter with heavy steps that reminds us of an agony its enormous frame long nose spherical back and the many folds of an elephant this exhibition invites us to the origin. While Oum is concerned with the fundamental matter of “seeing” she not only focuses on a broadening epistemological prospect but also how to broaden our lives through this exhibition.  Messages from elephants living with us - its original form passed on from ancient times - aren't visible in its hidden layers and folds (of numerous times and spaces). These folds are stretched open by the eye of the artist the blind the elephant and the audience.

It showcases a total 56 works covering her early and later years all of which belong to the Sakima Art Museum in Okinawa Japan. The exhibition is jointly held by the Center for Peace Museum.  The artworks on exhibition can be largely divided into before and after World War I in 1914. The Photo Gallery 1 presents the artworks that Kollwitz had produced after World War I. During this period the artist captured historical incidents that occurred throughout World War I and personal experiences such as the death of her son who died in action. The Photo Gallery 2 displays Kollwitz's early representative works before World War I including major series of artworks and portraits of female workers. The artworks express the conflicts between different socio-economic classes in the midst of Germany's rapid industrialization and the social problems that ensued.  The portrait of the artist who participated in relief activities with her doctor husband in poor villages and who formed her social consciousness while experiencing the war and hardships of the time reveals elements that are both autobiographical and historical. Her artworks consistently portrayed social irrationality which posed a threat to humanity as well as her desperate yet resolute resistance against wars.   We hope viewers will have the opportunity to glimpse into the social artistic and personal elements of Kollwitz's artwork through this exhibition.","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192847_ceaf8b81db8e48a397d3b3a6b803f24f_56d8da5b8fe043fc8f5ed3638a976052"

Celebrating its twenty-ninth year “Seoul Focus” departed from SeMA’s annual exhibition “Seoul Arts Festival” since 2012 concentrating on diverse issues related to a specific theme under its new title. On the heels of last year’s subject of contemporary Korean painting the current exhibition has selected “Public Service Advertising” as this year’s theme. The exhibition highlights the values of an era by introducing domestic and foreign public service advertisements that cover a variety of themes and epochs.   If advertisements are a “mirror reflecting society” public service advertisements are “activities that improve the society reflected in the mirror.” Public service advertisements influence the public’s positive actions by proposing ideas attitudes and practices that reflect a public character and acutely discern social problems of the period. The current exhibition focuses on these values of the period by presenting around seventy pieces of public service advertisements that embrace a diverse range of epochs and themes.   The exhibition comprises a diachronic section reflecting the history of Korea and a synchronic section that deals with global issues. With an attempt to show public concerns during the development of society and how advertisements reflected those concerns part 1 presents public service advertisements produced in Korea from the 1960s to the present. Part 2 introduces domestic and foreign public service advertisements that talk about global issues including the protection of the environment and wildlife and defending human rights. Messages of “sharing” and “caring” that  many countries deliver which concern universal problems in contemporary society no longer remain subjects dealt with only by photography or video but expand to diverse and integrated forms of media.    Public service advertisements question and suggest what a promising future should look like by revealing our social cultural and environmental problems. These advertisements strive to realize the value of coexistence and symbiosis. I hope this exhibition which attends once again to the voice of the public that may go unnoticed due to its omnipresence operates as a turning point for contemplating the values of making a better society. Furthermore I hope the exhibition becomes a place for communication where viewers can share innovative ideas an abundance of creativity and original thoughts alongside the theme of public service advertisements.  ※The title of the exhibition PSA is the Message is inspired by a phrase from Marshall McLuhan “The medium is the message.” ","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192848_bfabcc59e6d045d784f4611f6035292a_66ad0d3d04004e51940de314bf18722e"

The exhibition presents a wide array of artists from those who struggle with their minority identities as African immigrants residing in Europe or North America such as Yinka Shonibare and Chris Ofili to those who address epics on nationalism or religious conflicts in post-colonial Africa such as Goncalo Mabunda and Rachid Koraichi.   The exhibition aims to examine the basis of post-colonialism and also contemplate on the meaning of African diaspora art which can be traced back to Western colonialism and slavery. This would allow us to explore the critical viewpoints on Western-centrism and the racial and multicultural issues that occur on a global level. Ultimately considering Korea’s situation in which multiculturalism has become an issue of increasing seriousness the exhibition will provide an opportunity to assess the social awareness and attitude toward a multicultural setting.

Such a social change has led to the disintegration of ‘the family’ and ‘the community’ as we used to understand them. However new patterns of life and new concepts in space occupancy are being gradually disseminated throughout society.

This exhibition starts with questions such as 'What do low technologies mean in the era where high technologies are rampant?' 'Why are young artists interested in low technologies?' and 'How do technologies change art?'  Art has been changing alongside the advancement of technologies. Painting techniques have been developed with the advancement of paint and pigment technologies; photos and movies born from the age of mechanical reproduction have changed the direction of art into exploring art as a medium itself with the development of digital technologies ? which become dematerialized and digitized into  0 and 1 ? placed under a totally new condition called 'the transformation of data based on data and algorithm.' Of course such many branches of changing patterns cannot be simplified easily and the change of art would simply be driven by the elements of technology. Nonetheless we cannot deny the fact that technologies serve as an important factor in forming the background and condition in the flow of all changes of art itself.  In Korea which is one of the world's leading IT countries and where there are many early technology adopters young artists would naturally be sensitive to such technological changes and art/social environment driving such changes. What is important in the reality where art and technologies interfere with and cross over each other is returning to the backbone of technology ? whether it is good or bad ? and thinking about the technology as what Martin Heidegger who hoped for the possibility of artistic technology rather than a simple tool asserted i.e. technologies should return to techn?. According to Heidegger the concept of ancient Greek's techn? carried the meaning of handwork technology and the meaning of high-dimensional art (Poiesis) as well as the power of disclosure. This exhibition attempts to look into Heidegger's philosophy about technology through artworks by 10 young artists such as Kim Tae Eun Park Ki Jin Shin Sung Hwan Yang Jung Uk Lee Bei kyoung Lee Byung Chan Ye Seong Lee Woonwoo Lee Jung Sung Yoon Jung Ji Hyun as well as artworks by Yook Eae-jin Moon Joo Hong Sung Do.  The 10 artists who participate in this exhibition will present artworks reflecting their thoughts about technologies visually and intelligently: artists Jung Ji Hyun and Yang Jung Uk change the function of technology while concentrating on the mechanical mechanism itself by connecting it with our daily life; artists Kim Tae Eun and Park Ki Jin pose questions about the boundary between one's own reality and virtuality by basing on narratives; artists Shin Sung Hwan and Woonwoo Lee create a dreamy humorous space by using simple technology; artists Lee Bei kyoung and Lee Byung Chan express the fragments of a metropolitan life metaphorically through technology and; artists Jung Sung Yoon and Ye Seong Lee make viewers think about a medium itself through mechanical devices completed by visitors' participation. Artworks by artists Yook Eae-jin Moon Joo and Hong Sung Do who have been exploring the techniques and meaning of low technologies within the topology of the Korean art arena during the period 1980s?1990s will also be presented at this exhibition to enrich communications between the two generations.  This exhibition will provide a good opportunity for visitors to participate in some artworks by personally operating them at the exhibition hall and to take part in artists' creation processes such as formation patterning inference modeling play transformation and integration particularly since this exhibition is held during the winter vacation. Low technology and high technology ? old and new media ? form a new relationship through the contradictions and conflicts of each. They become contents and forms for each other endlessly reorganizing the present and the relationship between old and new. Let us now reflect on the meaning and direction of this era's technology and art by looking into the aesthetics of low technology.","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192845_57e5075947ad48728b11187a72c34927_8c5e446a9d9d49beb071b973e09991e9"

Jiseung craft refers to the construction of objects by weaving rolled hanji paper cords. Traditionally used in everyday life jiseung craft is becoming a forgotten discipline - even its name is unfamiliar to us. Jiseung craft is highly valuable because it possesses a plain and natural beauty that radiates from its unique texture. It is also a household item containing the traces of life.  Having studied textile art in college the artist has taken jiseung as her central theme. While focusing on modernizing the craft she pursues elements that are the most Korean. The artist reinterprets the traditional beauty of jiseung through her own perspective expanding it as a contemporary object and developing its aesthetic dimension. This exhibition introduces numerous bodies from Lee ranging from her early works that explore traditional paper craft her jiseung work and the interior objects she newly constructs.   This exhibition is largely divided into two groups: one that interprets traditional themes and techniques in a contemporary fashion and another interior objects produced from the coiling jiseung technique.

Byun has focused on the universality of life exposed through photography. Here he presents portraits that capture the particularity of people hidden behind their ordinariness. This work was produced through photographs of the various people whom he encountered on the shooting set of the KBS National Song Contest.   For about 30 years starting from its first broadcast in 1980 KBS 1TV ‘National Song Contest’ is a long-lasting program loved by many people. The artist for a long time has been working with the medium of the ‘portrait.’ He began the project ‘National Song Contest’ in 2005 and has been working on the pictures seriously for three years from 2012 to 2014.  The artist who states that an ‘individual’s identity is closely connected to one’s relation to the society’ exposes the desire the contestants face ? in the song contest - through the photographs. Furthermore he tries to show the ‘bare face’ of different generations living in contemporary times.  ‘National Song Contest’ project is a psychological report on contemporary figures observed by the artist. The work deeply reflects the artist’s idea that ‘the packaged and the processed are not the standard of beauty rather the raw state can be the barometer reflecting the present times.’ Through facial expressions and the poses of people in the photograph the artist draws the inner particularity of each person. Moreover the work exposes the strange and unfamiliar feelings manifested in the unique and splendid look of people from each region.     In this exhibition that spans the photo gallery 1 and 2 the audience can discover the artist’s intention. Through archival materials and videos presented with the project ‘National Song Contest’ the artist attempts to capture the contestants’ psychological desire beyond their gender and background. We hope the audience will have an opportunity to find new aspects of our interior psyche when encountering these unique individuals the artist has photographed in the field. This is a place where everybody can express their inner individuality from an equal plane without limitations of age and gender.","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192846_c48126b8e0594111b7c214646d2e8e4a_1944dcb536294bd39206c2f2f8ee992d"

A collection of frames constitutes a shot and then a sequence that acquires meaning. Rectangular units of meaning are projected on to a white flat screen. Most of the time the ‘screen-audience-projector’ paradigm set in order. In a theater the audience sits comfortably in soft seats though that may vary in some degree all facing toward to gaze at the silver screen. The word ‘screen’ connotes ‘protection’ or ‘partition’ The physical environment of a theater encourages the audience to metaphorically separate their minds from their bodies and absorb the world unfolded on the screen through the audiovisual senses only. The screen is perfect and solid in itself as if no external space exists like a window on the wall of shut-off space. The audience experiences virtual life and sense of time a window onto a world unto itself.   Moving image has rapidly broken away from the physical medium that is film and has embodied in more varied properties owing to the development of digital technology. This means we perceive cinema in various forms that were unimaginable before. The firm belief of the single screen has become softer over the last couple decades as it is interacts with para-cinematic media practices such as video art installation and performance. As mentioned earlier the screen contains the meaning of protection and partition. However we should be reminded that the screen is actually a semi-transparent shield. The screen hides and holds the audience in a simulacrum but it is open toward different worlds that mirror each other. The screen is fixed and settled yet fluid and flexible. It also connects while also separating the world of image and the world of the audience. It is like a variable gate and square which can be opened or closed. Accordingly the frames overlapping on the screen are not only perceived in a fixed environment in disposition of ‘screen-audience-projector’ but also able to exist in reflection of all imaginable forms. A soft screen can be folded bended overlapping and torn if necessary. Moreover it can also be transformed into anything that reflects. It can even be intangible images to someone who experience it without the form of a regular screen. In ‘Soft Screen : Montage of Dispositif’ the so-called screen can be attached to a wall in conventional way and also be located space between; it can be put on the floor or ceiling it can be placed inside or outside an exhibition hall.    Throughout the discussion for the show the participating artists have come to the realization that each is an ‘apparatus’ and lights up multiple screens of the exhibition space. The artists hope this montage of screens to become a unique one in a specific space and time at the spot where they coincide with audience to go beyond something that have been already filmed made or completed even if the practices being attempted on the ‘Soft Screen’ are not completely new. Visitors of this exhibition will be able to walk through the montage of the screens which are involved with each other as they individually exist in the exhibition space. The artist hope that visitors will become wandering editors in circular spaces while they experience some work of art that are loosely arranged and project themselves on to the soft screens to compose their own frames from what they have experienced.■ Jeon Hayoung","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192846_31d4bb3398a040079befb8ceec3158fa_90f3c2b4d71e46bb90b07a79e9f4e9cf"

First chosen for this exhibition to be a representative annual art show are eun yup kang a prominent artist leading the Korean sculpture scene and Ji Eun Kim drawing attention as one of the representative new generation artists.  The work of these two artists starts from where they are living. The work of eun yup kang who resides in the village beneath the foot of Cheonggye Mountain is a record of nature’s wonder her found in her everyday life while walking into the woods of the mountain with her 10 companion dogs. The work of Ji Eun Kim who has lived and worked at many art residencies at home and abroad is an outgrowth of her persistent observation and exploration of the places she has inhabited. In this exhibition based on the themes of kang’s A Walk with a Tree and Kim’s A Reflection on Urbanism respectively their work reflecting their ways of and attitudes toward life as different as their generation gap is intriguingly contrasted.   kang’s works comprised of photographs of the forest prints and sculptures using wood from forest trees are anchored in her complete comprehension of the “forest”. She documents nature’s wonder having observed the creation and extinction of trees that spread their roots and branches with endurance and wisdom and adapt themselves to ever-changing environments. kang attains a perfect assimilation into objects and generates sublime beauty by embracing nature as it is.   Ji Eun Kim collects all information through research and survey and unveils the hidden import and structure of such information. In this exhibition Kim displays her keen insight into the influence and issue of urbanism through scenes she observed in Seoul Byeokje Detroit and New York. Kim’s work seems to be a representation of a specific site but each scene intensively showcases the hallmarks of each city including its history social system and regulations. With this she raises urban issues such as suburbanization and gentrification.  The exhibition brings forth artistic conversations between these two artists representing two distinctly different generations allowing their works to confront each other and mingle in the same space.

The exhibition <The Relics of Old Seoul> focuses on the northern area of Seoul where Buk Seoul Museum is located. The show reexamines the image of old Seoul by revisiting forgotten lives within the landscapes that have disappeared in the process of the city’s modernization.  As a city development project that parallels the history of Korean modernism began in earnest since the 1960s many areas of Seoul have repeatedly encountered changes. In the process of moving the base of life mountain villages emerged in different areas of Seoul. As redevelopment projects were conducted in the 1970-80s mountain villages began to be demolished and low-rise apartments were built in their place. Only 20 years later the areas are changing to super high-rise apartment complexes - the developments are still ongoing.    This exhibition consists of artworks that contain the places that still keep the image of life in the past in the urbanization process centering around the northern area of Seoul. The works contain the memories of the city including houses that have disappeared throughout the development process and the images of life that is still maintained despite the changes. Through constructing archives related to 104 Village at Junggye-dong with photography video  installation and painting the exhibition enables viewers to see the aspects of the transition of the city through more diverse and objective perspectives.   We expect the exhibition <The Relics of Old Seoul> to be an opportunity to construct a new vision in the nostalgia aroused by memories of lives in the past and the changing images of the city while viewing the landscape that has already disappeared still disappearing in the present and will soon disappear.

It provides the children’s gallery as part of an exhibition program that reflects on the needs of local community. In the newly created space the visitors are mostly preschoolers kindergarteners elementary school children and family members. Furthermore in this space museum has a goal of running an educational exhibitions program that maximizes the viewing experience of the exhibition by fostering children’s appreciation of contemporary artwork and participating in the exhibition related programming. Following the former two exhibitions <Good Morning Mr. Robot> (the inaugural shows of the museum) and <I ♡ SEOUL> this third exhibition in the second half of 2014 presents art-born animals artistic expression of animals - which are familiar subjects for children - by choosing artworks that choose the twelve animals of the zodiac as subject matter of artists’ works. The exhibition proceeds by adopting part of the original story of the twelve zodiac animals and its background. The story begins with the structure that starts from a sky hill where the twelve zodiac animals coexist presuming the transcendental being of the sky the staging of a foot race by that existence awarding the ‘twelve animal signs’ and the power to protect humans to the runners who are tied for from 1st place to 12th place in the order of the arrival time - also granting mysterious powers as additional prize. After children audiences appreciate the twelve animals scattered around the museum with the tour guide - according to the order of the twelve zodiac animals -  they are able to experience the interactive artwork of Seong Joon Choi which runs the race of life as an adventure by creating an imaginative animal by compositing the twelve zodiac animals. Lastly with the question of ‘what if there were a new thirteenth zodiac sign?’ the exhibition stimulates the imagination of children audiences and finishes with <A Tale of Cat’s Tail Series> of the artist Zinoo Park who uses a cat - an animal unfortunately not included in the zodiac sign - as a subject matter. Using the subject matter of ‘the twelve zodiac animals’ this exhibition will be an opportunity for young audiences to learn ‘the twelve zodiac animals’ still handed down to us in the present through the process of searching seeing and experiencing the artworks in person.

In various forms a habit exists within our body in a similar density. It is quite physical so it suddenly appears like an allergic symptom regardless of one's will. The fact that it cannot be controlled intentionally arouses fear and at the same time a sense of relief which is a feeling that my self is being connected to something. It is an irresistible reaction to external antigens and another way of proving one's existence. Let's think for a moment not dichotomously?about whether 'a good habit' or 'a bad habit' is defined by a logic of self-development. A habit is like a regulation that operates a life on one's own. To a creator who looks at the world from his own perspective it is closely related to his 'uniqueness.' A habit is not a privilege given only to an artist. Despite that the reason that I want to pay attention to 'habit' is that an artist's habit has a quite sensitive feature and is considered to be a law of balance that keeps the self from the world. In addition it is a pattern of behavior that brings satisfaction to oneself. For that reason a habit is never a trivial thing for artists.  The artists participating in the exhibition created a new work starting from their own habits. Such works are closely related to oneself compared to other works. How meaningful would such artworks be to the artists themselves? It is hard to guess. However one thing is clear. Result originating from different points have a similar temperature. They are neither hot nor cold. They extract a concentrated solution that is converged into words that are frank to oneself let alone unnecessary modifiers. Let's now talk about how strong and heavy they are.■ Taehoon Choi ","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192847_39b840f8f1ad4dca99a546d96c72de52_9bc8420e151a4cea96daafcf28101568"

Hence through the keywords of ‘Ghosts Spies and Grandmothers’ this exhibition will retrospect on contemporary Asia. Ghosts stand for the forgotten history and tradition of Asia spies symbolize the memories of the Cold War and the grandmothers are metaphors of ‘women and time.’ The exhibited works however could transcend such themes or make a detour around them to present themselves in the state of ample possibility vis-?-vis the viewers. Thus the three keywords are three passages entering into the exhibition.    The term ‘Ghost’ refers to calling upon lonely ghosts omitted from recorded history to whose sorrow the current exhibition intends to carefully listen. Through such a calling the Biennale will look upon the modern and contemporary history of Asia mainly of the regions that have seriously suffered. Ghosts are also linked to ‘tradition.’ Asia is the birthplace of Buddhism Confucianism Shamanism Taoism and Hinduism and it is a continent still under deep religious influence. The exhibition focuses on how contemporary artists newly discover the traditions of such spiritual culture and how they invent new culture in such an atmosphere. We wish for the ghosts that had been chased away by modern science to return through media the alliance of media (art) and medium (psychic).   The term 'Spy' is the keyword chosen to bring attention to the particularly serious experiences of colonialization and the Cold War lived by Asia. The immense violence experienced together by East Asia and Southeast Asia resulted in war as well as extreme mutual social distrust and this situation is still greatly influential in the region. The 'Spy' theme is explored in the vast range of taboos asylum hacking of bank computer networks successful movies etc. Furthermore we will be able to witness how the creations of media artists applying code interpretation information and communication methods look similar to the ‘spy’ actions and how they would totally reverse the related values.    'Grandmother' is the witness who has endured and lived the ‘Era of Ghosts and Spies.’ The recently resurged conflict among Asian countries concerning the issue of comfort women reminds us once again of the fact that women exist at the core of the harm suffered by colonialization and war. On the other hand in Korean traditional culture ‘grandmother in the old days’ has the image of praying to the Divinity of Heaven and Earth for the benefit of her posterity with a bowl of fresh water in front of her. ‘Grandmother’ is probably a powerless being against authority but the endurance and compassion represented by the ‘grandmother in the old days’ can be reflected upon as an active value surpassing such power in the moral sense.  Spies seen in the movies look attractive but ‘spies’ are terrifying. One should worship god but stay far away from ghosts. Grandmothers should be respected but in reality they are expelled outside of the huge wave of praise for the young. You can notice them sometimes but they are generally difficult to spot or one does not wish to see them or should not see them. They are skilled in silence and possess top-level information. They are paradoxical beings.   We often comment that we get a glimpse of certain hope for change from the paradox of the rare ecosystem being preserved by the DMZ of the Korean peninsula. As such Mediacity Seoul 2014 is the platform of collective intelligence which strives to cultivate new hope of the human community from the hints of spells codes and dialect used by ghosts spies and grandmothers.

In other words insurance is a contract or discourse according to which the fortuitousness of the unknown future and the pattern of the past are converted into the ‘value’ of the present time. I think that the act of designing an insurance policy and visual artists’ tendency of converting value share some similarities.  That being the case what kind of insurance values and ripple effects does visual art have?  Existing health and automobile insurances have long neglected the value of future crises with the exception of those areas which traditionally have been protected by insurance. This applies to people who live in countries without medical insurance and do not have the right to pursue good health as well as to artists who do not reap the benefits of a pension. Artists’ projects probably begin from curiosity about future time as well as danger and anxiety from contingency and accidentality.   With their innate curiosity artists are able to depict the structural defects of contemporary society or produce alternatives to the defects through a series of works persistently and seriously.   The exhibition AIA (Art as Insurance as Art) is both an exploration of and a discourse about the act of artistic act of searching for ever-changing values and contradictions. ■ Daum Kim","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192844_815c425abf7d4f3e95d74b5eb6d64e78_1c9b0fa0063248e8a1915b0ff1df0099"

This exhibition begins from the exploration of Mundi Vita that is ‘lives of the world’ or lives within the world. If art can have a tiny handful of meaning in this contemporary world where all kinds of disasters and dangers lurk it lies only in the fact that art never ceases to agonize doubt and question.   In front of questions such as ‘Is sustainable life possible?’ ’What would be an alternative life to capitalism?’ artists of today ask for the meaning of life in this world. Instead of clear answers artists testify to the absence of lives and signal towards an immeasurably vulnerable existence through all kinds of gaps traces memories and images left by all the lives in the world. The artists of today endlessly and readily spread their tentacles groping the absence breaks traces and memories for the living.   By turning the techniques of textile that possess traits of craft into a medium of contemporary art Cha Seungean’s works that consist of thread and fabrics are a kind of condolence. Cha does this for those who’ve had to bear the trauma of facing reality in the absence of life as well as the all the dangers that endlessly threaten us. Not only this but also acknowledging that the essence of danger originates from ourselves. Particularly the site-specific installation in the corridor of the 3rd floor in the Seoul Museum of Art comforts us by spreading the fissures and traces of life as condolences in the space.  Lee Hyein records memories and sensibilities in ‘Empty Address’ which created in unpermitted places and is swept away in time through her unique painting that combines solid architectural compositions and surrealistic elements. The artist shows an artistic examination and response to  the current catastrophes in the new work <Blind Painting> and in her 2010 work <Ghost Ship> that is an uncanny d?j?vu of the Sewol ferry disaster. These works allow us to hear a voice of introspection and record that tiny handful of meaning that art delivers in a world full of fear.  As a part of a more practical approach SeMA will hold ‘Reading Event’ and art learning programs for kids. Through these artistic practices we hope to share a belief in the power produced by the human voice and in the very small changes that are potentially created by art.","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192845_b369f078750c4e6db1f52f59e50914cb_0a189ebb0f8a420d9811899647c3eca7"

Even if they can be explained in words there is no guarantee that such explanations would mean something and even if they did mean something not everyone would feel the same. In addition some happenings may be explained but many of it cannot be shown in reality. Even if they can be happened not everyone could feel them. And even though some people may feel them not everyone could enjoy them.   The only way to explain perceived though faint feelings is through efforts to reach the most approachable state while arranging unclear ambiguous descriptive regardless of one’s logical intentions. Thus when we state that we share feelings it already connotes incongruity. This is because feelings are quite subjective and the feelings that we sense cannot be fully grasped.   However we certainly believe in the substance of feelings. Indeed we must. As feelings are the starting point of all of our small actions the incidents that we face at our daily creative sites and are the most trustworthy conduit connecting you and me such ambiguous feelings should be dealt with as seriously as (we would deal with) the history of art.    Thus we temporarily set aside the problem of reproductions or the stereotype of transparent meanings but we concentrate on this moment in order to seize the essence floating in metaphorical conversations and ambiguous incomplete reasoning.   How much are we different; how much are we the same?  We carefully measure the distance between ourselves and our neighbors and measure the depth of inhalation and exhalation as we grope around our circumference waddle sideways.  The principles of formativeness such as harmony balance and tension are like a journey in search of a passage of feelings that would connect you and me beyond the problem of a mere arrangement. This is to explore close relationships that would form a sense of neighborliness and to accept the possibility of an open ending.

The exhibition <Universal Studios Seoul> presents the works of foreign artists who have been living and working in Korea and attempts to start a dialogue on the image of Korea that is expressed and perceived in their art as well as the perspectives that Koreans have towards foreign artists.  The thirteen artists invited to this exhibition come from ten different countries including Japan Germany the Netherlands UK Spain Canada Czech Republic India Singapore and Australia.  After arriving in Korea for various purposes such as work marriage studies abroad or curiosity these artists have been living and working in Korea for 1 year to 20 years. The artist Emil Goh is also included in this exhibition whose sudden death in 2009 while working in Seoul prompted a wave of mourning in the Korean art community.  The exhibition’s title referencing the Hollywood theme park alludes to the ‘universal’ phenomenon of contemporary nomadic life represented inside these foreign artist’s ‘studios.’ Furthermore the title signifies the cultural fantasies that naturally present themselves in the encounter between different cultures - for example a foreign artist’s romantic biases or critical perspectives on Korea or inversely the Korean expectation towards foreign artists.  It is natural that the attitude of artists who see the familiar in an unfamiliar way or the natural unnaturally develops into an interesting result through the experience of settling in a different culture. This exhibition features works of art that preserve their artistic characteristics prior to migrating to Korea and works that deal with the situation of Korea within universal themes as well as artworks that actively employ the specificities of Korean history and culture politics and division and urban landscape and daily life as subject matter. By exhibiting the works of artists made before and after coming to Korea this exhibition allows audiences to observe changes within aesthetic attitudes themes and subject matter influenced through one’s place of residence.  The exhibition catalogue provides images of artists’ works along with artists’ creative thoughts in the form of text poetry drawing and photography. This textual component was developed through a prompt given to each artist in which they were asked to respond to five key words:‘Home Language Cultural Fantasy Passport and Seoul.’ In addition to this through performance round-table discussions and artist talks we will provide an opportunity to examine how artists respond to Korea and Korean culture through different perspectives and expressions.    ● Opening Reception & Performance - 2014. 6. 17. 5-6pm at the exhibition hall (1F)   1.

We are artists who like experimenting and playing with things from perspectives unlike any other in the rest of the world. As such we have the privilege of being able to enjoy more freedom in Korea than anyone else. However we have been suppressing our exploding imaginations due to our poverty and limited space as well as to others’ attention. In search of genuine freedom under the leadership of Park our captain we formed a community in Nanji-do a place where nobody comes. Then we picked up a load of trash and built the Nanji Residency with that trash. The Nanji Residency is not a residency space; rather; it is a space base called SEMA 110-248-463566. Recently a planet called QUIRA 1218 which is 22 light years away from and has a similar environment to the Earth was discovered. This outer planet is the only space where we can realize our intention free from the interference of any system format or government officials.     We immediately constructed a kind of transmission/reception tower. Others have misconstrued it as a transmission tower and feel pity for us but the tower is being used as a radio telescope to determine whether there is any civilized living organism on QUIRA 1218. A nice hydrogen fuel tank has also been built next to the Hangang River. It is decent enough to travel 22 light years. If there is not enough fuel we can stop by the Sun. We have also built two space ships one for women the other for men. The ships are now disguised as exhibition halls. We have built all these facilities by extracting materials from the waste matter on Nanji-do. It took us eight years to complete them.    It is now time to depart. We must leave now. The engine of the space base can no longer stand the pressure of the hydrogen tank. As lubricating oil is leaking through cracks on the cooling box of the engine a smell like gasoline pervades everything here. We must escape this year before the base explodes.  According to the calendar of the earth we will hold a farewell party at 5pm on June 13 2014 before departing to Quira1218. We will open our spacecraft and serve our space food to our visitors. We will also showcase the information we have obtained from our observations of space. The radio telescope of the transmission tower has confirmed that organisms similar to human beings are living on QUIRA 1218. It has been confirmed that they live by hunting and fishing---the way of life led by humans before the agricultural revolution. All the things we do will become ‘initial’. They will also become the first legend in the history of art to last into later generations. We hope that visitors will congratulate our glorious new beginning with pleasure.

The exhibition is intended to take a view of a stream of contemporary Korean photography by shedding light on works by six overarching Korean photographers(VIP) who worked in the 1950s and 1960s.   The 1950s and the 1960s was a period when Korean society and the Korean photo-scene underwent considerable change. The situations of the times after the turbulent period of liberation from Japanese colonial rule and the Korean War gave rise to realism reflecting reality and everyday life and another art movement exploring the true nature of things within an individualist world. A variety of experiments with such themes and expressive methods served as momentum to extend the category of contemporary Korean photography.   The exhibition consists of two parts: RIHP Collection and SeMA collection. Vintage photographs1) of Hyun Il Young Lee Hae Sun and Lee Hyoung Rok chosen from the RIHP Collection display a balance between a documentary photography style and modeling quality transcending standardized tendencies of realism and pictorialism of the time. Photographs selected from the SeMA Collection are works of Han Young Soo Hong Soon Tae and Joo Myung Duck featuring candid aspects of life in Korea especially in Seoul in the 1950s and 1960s. Their works anchored to the intrinsic properties of documentary photography while seeing aspects from a humane perspective show a vivid sense of reality capturing aspects and transfiguration of Korean society and life.  The exhibition also enhances viewer understanding of activities and backgrounds by exhibiting relevant magazines and exhibition catalogs that provide information on the trends of the then photographic scene. The 1950s and 1960s was a turning point in contemporary Korean photography history when numerous photographers experimented with intrinsic attributes of photography record and choice. The art show will be an opportunity to explore the trace of time of the 1950s and 1960s and share six participating artists’gazes and art-worlds.

SeMA BLUE exhibition focuses on the artists of aged 30-40s. This year SeMA BLUE exhibition Malfunction Library pays attention to the highly developed ‘knowledge information society’ in which an access to all sorts of information and knowledge has become easy but choosing the one has become difficult.   9 people/teams of the artists in this exhibition express their critical viewpoints towards the knowledge information society. Although they cannot be called knowledge producers in a traditional sense they also produce alternative or secondary information/knowledge which may not be included as a mainstream but has potential possibilities through the means of information collecting and processing and rearranging based on persistent research. Their creative activities are expressed through what seems strange information the various forms of information surrounding the contemporary and create ‘Malfunction Library’ which is the total space of the accumulated odd knowledge and information.   The exhibition will be more interesting if you freely walk around the works of ‘Malfunction Library’ which are connected with the infinite ‘links’ and find the operation errors and correct what you used to know rather than following directions and certain statements. By independently rearranging and re-contextualizing information you can create new information as an ‘independent thinker’ or ‘alternative knowledge producer’ like the artists of this exhibition.   Through the creative activities of the artists who are living ‘here now’ SeMA BLUE 2014 Malfunction Library will give you an opportunity to reflect present knowledge/information environment and to think independently.

Sound art developed under direct and indirect influence of contemporary art that goes as far back as the Futurist Manifesto’s Art of Noise leading to more recent figures such as John Cage. This exhibition by substituting ‘visual space’ with ‘aural space’ looks back on various musicians who appeared in Korea since the 90s placing them within the context of media technology and subculture.  As an experimental attempt at the very listening mechanism itself Noise lets the participating musicians’ harmonies mingle altogether and create a ‘garden of noise’. As for the audience they would use headphones to actively ‘connect’ themselves to live videos or recordings thus forming individual temporalities. By allowing the audience to use a computer to gather videos recordings and texts and to create their own DIY leaflets Noise will provide an active and participatory experience based on performativity― as opposed to passively appreciating a given exhibition they engage in the production of personalized objects.   The spectrum of participating musicians was expanded to include the earlier generation that began performing since the late 90s typified by improvisation on noise taken from machines or media rather than chords or harmonies (Kwon Byung-jun Ryu Han-kil Jin Sangtae Choi Joon-yong Transistorhead Hong Chul-ki) and the more recent generation of experimental musicians who form a flexible collaborative system based on electronic music (Graye Damirat Rumahan Byul.org Mimyo Miiin SklavenTanz Sima Kim Odaeri Se Chung Choi Taehyun haihm The Hitchhiker). The underlying intention is to diverge from superficial categorization such as genres and to understand the sound art phenomenon within a wider context namely medium and subculture.  The exhibition is composed mainly of live videos and audios produced by those who are not only front runners of today’s sound art scene but who are also active in the international field. Commonly used platforms for posting works and communicating with listeners such as websites and Soundclould pages are also introduced to shorten the distance between the museum the audience and the musicians. Not to be missed is the collaborative album by Odaeri and pope x pope which was recorded specially for the exhibition and will be displayed along with their live footage. Furthermore artist talks and workshops which are scheduled to be held for four sessions will help better understanding of contemporary art and sound art and their increasingly diminishing interdisciplinary boundaries. Such efforts will also provide opportunities to promote communication between the musicians and the audience.","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192844_34ae43042d9146e1adf383b965d14c60_2ab4c1da524540ac861692153a5609e3"

Cho Su Ho a member of the National Academy of Arts has been widely admired for the great diversity and creativity he achieved in the Korean art of calligraphy.  This Exhibition consists of about fifty works in several genres ranging from works of calligraphy by old and modern masters to literati paintings including the works donated by the artist Cho Su Ho - some of which have never before been displayed in public. The exhibition is designed to break away from the chronological format traditionally adopted for retrospective exhibitions and instead present a comprehensive view of the rich and unique aesthetic heritage materialized in his works which are arranged to show how the artist evolved in his efforts to expand and transform his art by exploring the borders between abstract painting and East Asian calligraphy. The exhibition also displays some of tools and implements the artist used to produce his works a meticulous reproduction of part of his studio and a video clip containing an interview in which the artist talks about his life and art helping viewers deepen their understanding of the exhibited works.  Cho Su Ho was born in 1924 in Seonsan Gyeongsangbuk-do and was introduced to the basics of calligraphy when he was just five years old. He studied art in Daegu Normal School and was admitted to the Department of Western Painting at Seoul National University. It was when he was 26 years old and still an SNU student that he won the Special Commendation Prize (Teukseon) at the first National Art Exhibition of Korea held in 1947. Thereafter he won the same prize four more times at the same event and became the first awardee of the National Art Exhibition Invited Artist Prize in 1974. His studies of western painting during his college years became a precious asset for his career in calligraphy as they provided him with valuable opportunities to acquire comprehensive knowledge about different categories of art including literati painting art history and artistic philosophy as well as western painting from distinguished scholars at the university. His academic experience at the university also helped him achieve his own style in the East Asian genre of calligraphy and ink wash painting. His ink wash paintings exploring the relationship between painting and calligraphy are now widely regarded as the precursors of a new vision of Korean calligraphy in the 21st century.       Critics are generally agreed that Cho Su Ho created his own form of art thanks to his progressive attitude and his experiments in harmony between Eastern and Western aestheticism which contributed greatly to the effort to bring Korean calligraphy to a wider public in Korea and the rest of the world. The works selected for this exhibition are great examples of the artist's belief that 'there exist all kinds of paintings in calligraphy' and his contribution to the artistic development of Korean calligraphy. They are expected to guide visitors to a deeper understanding of Dongkang's art and the new aesthetic sensibility he brought to calligraphy.   The exhibition is expected to guide art lovers to this fine collection of donated works with the aim of showing the new direction which Cho Su Ho believed the art of Korean calligraphy should follow. It is also intended to shed new light upon the distinguished artistic achievements of this great master calligrapher of our time.  Finally we the organizers of the exhibition at the Seoul Museum of Art (SeMA) would like to express our sincere gratitude to Master Dongkang and his family for the donation of this outstanding collection of great art works.

Lee was a pioneer who contributed to the development of Korean modernism after studying abroad.   This exhibition consists of the museum's small collection of artworks donated by the artist's bereaved family in 2013 as well as thirty drawings and oil paintings owned by Lee's family and never before disclosed to the public. It will focus on the period during which the artist embodied the 'lyrical abstract space' that characterized his work after the turning point in his career marked by his period of study in Paris by presenting a series titled Imagery which consists of his drawings and oil painting from the 1980s and 1990s and by breaking away from the existing chronological and retrospective method. It will provide visitors with an opportunity to experience the artist's impromptu and subjective style and his rhythmical composition of colors forms strokes lines and surfaces along with the five-color structure that he created by adding black and white to the three-primary colors of red blue and yellow which constitutes an important element of his work. The exhibition space is organized in such a way as to improve visitors' understanding of his artworks and includes a video of an interview with the artist recorded for a program titled TV Art Museum in 1991 which showed the evolution of his art through sketches and drawing books reflecting the artist's ideas.    Lee was born in Seoul in 1921 and studied in Tokyo and Paris. After returning to Korea in the late 1960s he sought to define the identity of Korean modern art while expanding the scope of his art to such genres as large-scale wall paintings interior decoration stainless glass and tapestry. In addition he also demonstrated just as much outstanding ability in his work as an art administrator as he did in his career as an artist. He attended the 5th IAA (International Art Association: a UNESCO agency that assists the creative activities of artists) held in Tokyo in 1966 and held the exhibition financed by the Japanese Government for the first time by organizing and presenting the Korean Modern Painting Exhibition in 1968 at the National Museum of Modern Art in Tokyo. Thereafter he held a retrospective exhibition in 1991 which looked back on his work during his 50-year career. He served as the first director of the Art Sonje Center. He also attended the CIMAM (International Committee for Museums and Collections of Modern Art) in 1994 and contributed to the construction of the Korean Pavilion for the Venice Biennale between 1993 and 1995.   We would like to express our sincerest appreciation for the donation of works of art by Lee SeDuk who played a pioneering role in the development of Korean modernism during a time when the art education environment in Korea was very poor. We wish to share the kind consideration of the bereaved family of the artist with the public through this exhibition.  Exhibition of Donated Art Works I ? Hwang Chang Bae     Buk Seoul Museum of Art will be holding the Exhibition of Donated Art Works I to celebrate the donation of the works of art by Hwang Chang Bae(1947-2001).

The Exhibition of Donated Art Works I is comprised of his works from the early and mid-90s that were donated by his family the museum's collections his works from the 80s and his representative works from the late 90s owned by his family. This exhibition has moved away from the typical format of the retrospective exhibit which is usually divided by periods shape and themes and instead displays his work based on the late 80s and 90s when the artist reached the peak of his experimental techniques. This allows the visitors to understand the characteristics of his artwork which incorporates a contemporary feel in the traditional painting method. In addition Hwang's drawings and painting tools that he used at his artelier in Goesan until he died and the video data from the TV program TV Art Museum in 1992 are also displayed to increase the understanding of his work.  Hwang Chang-Bae was born in Seoul in 1947 and graduated from the College and Graduate School of Fine Arts at Seoul National University. He also studied engraving and calligraphy under Chulnong Lee Ki Woo and Chinese classics and art history under Im Chang Soon. In 1977 he received a prize from the Minister of Culture and Public Information at the National Art Exhibition and in 1978 he was awarded the president’s award as an artist of Oriental drawing in non-figurative art for the first at the National Art Exhibition. Then he worked as a professor and between December 1988 and February 1989 was invited by the U.S. State Department to conduct a project at the New York Artist’s Colony residency. After Hwang visited North Korea as a member of the Research Group of Cultural Heritages in North Korea of the Unification and Culture Research Institute of the JoongAng Ilbo in 1997 he held the “Exhibition of sketching out North Korea” at the Sun Gallery in Seoul in 1998.

SeMA's 2013 collection of artworks consists of representative contemporary artworks made with various media artworks by Korea's representative veteran artists and artworks that are significant in the history of art. It is hoped that these works which have been collected in accordance with the new collection policies established by SeMA in 2012 will help visitors understand the recent directions taken by Korean contemporary art. In addition the new collection will strike a balance between various genres such as Korean painting painting drawing & etching photography sculpture installation art and new media.  The exhibition title Gift has the meaning of a communication which intends to share SeMA's art collection with citizens and is a way of expressing appreciation to the artists who have donated artworks to the collection. In fact the artworks which have been donated during the last year account for more than 25% of the 2013 collection.   The exhibition hall on the first floor of the main building has been redesigned as a 'Gift Box' to house the new collection which will establish the identity of SeMA in the coming years. The exhibition will consist of three differentiated sections namely box F box P and box M according to the trend demonstrated by the new collection.   This exhibition will provide an opportunity for visitors to perceive the essence of visual art from multi-faceted perspectives and enjoy various sociocultural discussions on contemporary art through the presentation of the ongoing artworks by young and veteran artists in addition to artworks that have forged a significant place in the history of art such as Feminist art during the 1980s and '90s.

By using plants as a medium this exhibition aims to investigate how a series of groups have been organized and how they are responding to specific political social and economic issues.   The two artists have been collecting seeds and information that represent groups of artists from around the world which are being operated in a unique form and method. As a result “The Growing Manual” (2012) which resembles a guide book introducing artist groups was published. The exhibition “The Growing Manual” can be said to be a live form of the previously-published book. By conducting an experiment of cultivating plants that usually grow in environments such as Cuba Mexico Brazil Malaysia and Taiwan at a new environment and under new conditions such as the Seoul Museum of Art this exhibition approaches conceptual titles such as “Formation responding to a given condition” and “existence” in a more concrete and direct way.   Plants play a central role in “The Growing Manual” and the exhibition is divided into three compositions through the medium “plants”: 1) plants 2) various forms of information about each group that is represented by plants and 3) works of art made with sculptural structures that use plants as a medium. Then why plants? “Plants” are a metaphorical tool used to express the condition and environment of particular areas and to show a form that adapts to a given environment and condition. That is the 11 species of plants that growing within the gallery are used to describe artist groups that are being operated in a unique method and form as they adapt to a given environment. Various forms of information such as texts photos and videos that are suggested along with the plants express the political social and economic circumstances of the particular regions to which each group belongs.   This exhibition begins with collecting seeds and ends with cultivating plants. It works like a manual showing the growth process of artist groups that are being compared to plants. Furthermore it hopes to raise the basic question 'How can the plants continuously grow in a natural setting?'

Seoul Museum of Art is hosting the Chaos-SunkooYuh exhibition at the SeMA Nam Seoul Living Arts Museum. This exhibition has been brought to you as a part of the national network of municipal art museums in cooperation with the Clayarch Gimhae Museum.     Sunkoo Yuh is a ceramist who has been engaging in art activities in the US since he graduated from university. After he received the Grand Prize at the Gyeonggi International Ceramic Biennale(GIC Biennale) in 2003 his artwork was introduced to the Korean art arena. He challenges the limitation of sizes of ceramics as a medium opening up a new horizon in ceramic sculptures beyond the typical techniques used in said genre.     His artworks show figures expressing the multi-layered self as well as a mixture of various symbols of the West and East such as shapes and figures depicting the influence of Christianity Buddhism and Korean traditional folktales and paintings. They portray the journey of his life-his upbringing in Korea and his art life in the US including his attitudes as a whole and his longing to communicate fundamental human universality that supersedes West and East.     This exhibition showcases ceramic sculptures hanji (Korean paper) artworks and ceramic drawings done during his early years as an artist and in recent years. His unique characters started out as plain drawings on hanji paper and changed to multi-dimensional ceramic sculptures. In recent years he expanded his art world to ceramic drawings that he worked on in Jing de Zhen China. This exhibition is expected to be an excellent opportunity for visitors to see and experience the artist's unique art world.

SeMa Gold is one of the three SeMA color exhibitions (blue gold and green) which are held every other year to illuminate on each generation of Korean Art world. SeMA Gold particularly focuses on middle-aged artists of 50s and 60s to view the present situation and future of Korean Art. Through the exhibition <Nobody> you will be able to see vivid artistic records of the overseas Korean artists whose works are considered another branch of Korean art. The work will show how the artists confronted the world and themselves who in the situation of Diasporas could not belong anywhere but belong everywhere as nobody.   Yong Soon Min (1953~) who is based on Los Angeles is working as an artist activist curator and an art-educator and deals with the issue of identity that she herself her parents’ generation and all of us face. Particularly in this exhibition she tries to illuminate on ‘nobody’ living with us in Korean society. In other words she artistically shed light on Diaspora in Korea living under the name of foreign workers married migrated women North Korean defectors and refugees. Sook Jin Jo (1960~) is working in New York and she has been noted for her work which uses and trims abandoned woods to express fundamental energy of life and ultimate cause of existence. To her something abandoned discarded and useless are represented as ‘nobody’ but this ‘nobody’ is rather a trace and key to the most important secrets of life. Jin-me Yoon (1960~) who is based on Vancouver Canada is an artist who has been inquiring into the problem of place and identity in a post-colonial aspect. Her works show how Mother Nature such as swamp bush and grassland and the shadow of civilization such as city war and disaster are experienced through her body. Jin-me Yoon’s works imply artistic possibility of overcoming ‘nobody’ as an artist of ‘nobody’ herself.      Seoul is also becoming a foreign land with so many immigrants and people leaving their homes. Through this exhibition try to follow the artistic paths of the three women artist Yong Soon Min Jin-me Yoon and Sook Jin Jo who sought to build their own artistic world for more than 20-30 years at the crossing point of different cultures in a foreign land. Furthermore reflect on certain aspect of Korean society with the viewpoint of foreigners minorities women and strangers like they did. Notably the exhibition will be more interesting if you can compare how the three artists differently expressed the issue of identity which they continuously confronted in a reinforced situation of outsider as non-western women artists.

This exhibition started from a modest proposition: “Invisible unless we pay attention.” It deals with the real stories of 35 million refugees worldwide and 350 refugees in Korea and makes “invisible people” visible through on of the most advanced technology the 3D miniature. Refugees who may be unfamiliar to most Koreans can be defined as “People who are outside their own country because they have suffered persecution or they fear of persecution on account of race religion political opinions or ideas.” Just half a century ago Korea also had many refugees from the Korean War. Statistics related to refugees are not well known but the number of refugees coming to Korea is steadily increasing. Many refugees come to Korea with hope referring to Korea as “the homeland of Ban Ki-moon Secretary-General of UN” or “a nation of human rights.” As of the end of November 2013 more than 6400 people have made a refugee application to the Korean government; some 350 applicants recognized as refugees are living in Korea. In recent years saeteomin people (North Korean defectors) are have become an issue in Korea. They have been living in Korea but they are treated as invisible people.   For this exhibition palm-sized 3D miniatures were produced based on videos of actual refugees such as the ones living in Korea and camps in Nigeria Africa; stories about each refugee are presented at the museum of art via digital media. Dozens of 3D miniatures of refugees are installed in crevices in the museum such as stairs window sills and shelves in restrooms; for each miniature has QR and NFC codes so that visitors can see videos of the stories of actual refugees associated with the figurines just by connecting with their cell phones. In addition since the codes are connected to official SNS visitors can personally send encouraging messages to refugees.  However visitors may not be able to see the refugees clearly due to unpredictable circumstances or owing to the small size of videos. If more people have the chance to meet refugees and become curious about their stories the refugees themselves will no longer remain as invisible people and they will get more attention from the world. Through technology that can warm up the world if visitors attempt to communicate with refugees at the exhibition refugees will reveal themselves. This exhibition will make us realize that we coexist with refugees.

It will be held at four public art museums in Seoul Daejeon Gyeongnam Gwangju under different themes.   The exhibition is trying to portray multiple identities of people navigating in an increasingly complex media environment today. This includes works by photographers (Koo Sang Mo Chanmin Park Seung Woo Back Seo Yeoung Won Taewon Jang Heeseung Chung Han Sungpil); by video and installation artists employing photography (Youngmin Kang Moonho Lee Lee Sang Hyun Cho Yikyung Ha Tae-Bum); by a photojournalist (Park Jongkeun); and a participatory video installation work composed of photos people uploaded on SNS(Cha Ji-ryang).   '4 AM' in the subtitle is derived from the short novel 'Mapping in Darkroom' which was published by Lee Sang a Korean writer in 1932 under his pen-name Bigu. In the story '4 AM' is the moment when the main character meets his other self - Lee Sang- when he goes to bed at 4 am. Thus the subtitle “4 AM” does not necessarily mean time but a metaphor of “a new dimensional space.” Falling half asleep Lee Sang goes to the movies to a zoo and to a restroom as he walks around between time and space without knowing whether it is a real or imaginary world. It is as if he is spending a whole day on an imaginary map.   Media images which directly reflect lives of people in the present times are parallel to “light in the night” as well as to “the self” which plays multiple roles within the media environment. In 1932 Lee Sang sleeps with the fluorescent light on until the early morning. In 2014 people check in their Facebook or play music videos on YouTube or look at photos on Instagram and Twitter with the light off in a dark room as if they rummage through their Smartphones. 'Mapping the Darkroom' or an imaginary map which Lee Sang drew while sleeping has become our reality today.  We now live in a new world where the virtual and real the genuine and fake you and I co-exist in space and time and where intermixed images and texts have a existential value in society. People often experience a mixed feeling of isolation and solidarity at the same time as they wade through this disorderly space. Photography and Media: 4 AM attempts to offer viewers time to think about the uncertainty of the self memory scenery and floating images and information which cannot be clearly defined or in a state that any definition is no longer meaningful.    ***Artist Talks at Exhibition Hall*** 2014.

The Seoul Focus exhibition (previously titled the Seoul Art Exhibition) is celebrating its 28th anniversary this year. The preceding 27th exhibition was a turning point that saw a breakaway from the conventional exhibition format and suggested a new direction for the Seoul Art Exhibition with a focus on special exhibitions to be held under various themes and issues through specific media.  As the new name of the Seoul Art Exhibition (held annually throughout the long history of the Seoul Museum of Art) Seoul Focus alludes to the staging of special exhibitions with more clearly defined themes.  Under the theme of Modern Korean Painting this exhibition attempts to shed light on the future vision of Korean painting in the midst of contemporary art trends by inviting artists who have majored in Korean painting and who continue breaking new ground in terms of format and content. To explore this new movement in Korean painting which emerged around 2000 the exhibition will focus intensively on the creative tendency among artists who are now in their 30s and 40s and who are experimenting freely under the influence of the 1st generation who opened up a new field in Korean painting after much experimentation with traditional Korean writing brushes and ink sticks.   This exhibition aims to enhance visitors’ understanding and appreciation of the production techniques of Korean painting by offering a number of exhibition-related programs specially designed to enable them to try their hand at applying techniques of Korean painting themselves with the help of participating artists.   Through the voice of contemporary artists who are at the juncture between traditional genres and an exciting new contemporary art field and who are engaged in a quest for new ideas this exhibition will suggest a new direction for future artists and serve as a great venue where visitors can sense the evolution of Korean painting.

It The will showcase an unconventional exhibition where the paintings by artists Jang Jinhwa and Kim Taeho co-exist with antique stoves at an elegant exhibition space of the SeMA Living Arts Museum. The space was formerly the Belgium Consulate in the Modern Age.   Introduced for the first time at the exhibition the antique stoves are a collection by the artist Jan Hwajin. These types of stoves were once common throughout Korea Japan and Europe. Their dated details show their functions of warming up a home or cooking food. Moreover their craftwork reveals the popular designs and the technological development of each era.    Jang Hwajin and Kim Taeho who are Korea's renowned artists present their modern take on the antique stoves and introduce their recent artworks through the artists' independent exhibitions. By reinterpreting the antique stoves and the SeMA Living Arts Museum with their unique individualities the two artists reveal a world of elegance that evokes meditation and healing in the current contemporary period and space. The exhibition Atelier with Stoves will offer new aesthetic experiences that cross the boundaries between practical and pure art.        1st Floor:  Jang Hwajin's Modern Taste (Exhibition Halls 1-5)   Among his recent artworks artist Jang Hawjin presents a modern taste series through floor tile painting along with his presentation of the antique stoves. The artist's new artworks are introduced by using the old tiles in the current SeMA Living Arts Museum as a motif along with the artworks related to the history of modern times including the architecture of Jeonggwanheon and Jungmyeongjeon Halls of Deoksugung Palace. These artworks which incorporate the artist's philosophy will provide an elegant artistic space with traces of the past life through antique stoves.            2nd Floor:  Kim Taeho's Mindscape (Exhibition Halls 6-11)  Artist Kim Taeho’s recent artworks and his formative beauty of antique stoves will be presented at this exhibition.

This year the newly renamed assistance program has been expanded to include various genres of art in order to reflect the new trends of contemporary art in accordance with the museum’s intention of supporting talented artists working in various experimental genres. Furthermore whereas the assistance previously focused on solo exhibitions this year’s exhibition consists of a joint exhibition of works by 28 artists.   The title of this exhibition“Round-Up”is a news and media term referring to ‘a summary of recent facts and events’. The exhibition is designed to showcase the representative artworks of twenty-eight artists who have held solo exhibitions around Seoul during 2013 with the museum’s assistance. It attempts to express the passion and pure desire of these young artists by configuring various artworks by the selected artists which cannot be defined under one theme in an intentionally-exaggerated or conflicting fashion within the exhibition hall.   The Artist Relay Event will enable visitors to enjoy various forms of artwork during the exhibition period through direct communication with contemporary artists who might otherwise be perceived as distant or difficult. In addition the exhibition will feature an exhibition space introducing ‘The New Artist Exhibition Assistance Program’ along with data related to the solo exhibitions of twenty-eight selected new artists to enable visitors to see the progress of the exhibition assistance program over the past six years and to review the role and future direction of the program.   It is hoped that this exhibition will provide a valuable opportunity for visitors to enjoy a wide spectrum of contemporary artworks by passionate young artists as well as various events such as Artist Relay Event.

"000200","Analog Welcome Digital Archive","","NANJI RESIDENCY NANJI Exhibition Hall","2013-11-16","2013-12-15","","","Seoul Museum of Art","2pm ~ 6pm(Close Mon.)","","","","","","Foreword on <Analog Welcome Digital Archive>  PARK Soonyoung | Curator SeMA NANJI RESIDENCY   SeMA NANJI RESIDENCY (SNR) opened in 2006 at a refurbished obsolete water treatment facility. From the beginning to 2009 it has been serving its role as a creative studio by providing working spaces to aspiring artists. Since 2010 it also has transformed itself as a residency program by utilizing the advantage of a residency being strong in forming network and communicating with public institutions. In the year of 2013 there has been many changes in SNR. Following the Seoul Museum of Art (SeMA)'s 2012 vision Post Museum SNR has expanded the scope of its activities to outside of the country by forming international network.    Forming network through exchange is most important in a residency program and it has a strong advantage to operate so. This is one of the main objectives of the artists participate in residency programs and residency programs operate in a way to effectively meet the objective. SNR has excellently established its foundation as a creative studio and expanded its activities to a global level. SNR joined the  international residency network hub Res Artis and select artists from the international contests and promotes international exchange exhibitions every year. This November SNR opens an exchange exhibition with Songzhuang Art Center in Beijing China. Regarding the variety of Contemporary art the extent of exchange should not be restricted in domestic but should be promoted internationally. <Analog Welcome Digital Archive> is one of the practices for this cause. Organized by the Alternative Space Loop this exhibition will create a platform in SNR to introduce the leading institution in Media art around the world.   Directors of the participating institutions such as Bernhard Serexhe from ZKM Germany and HatanaKa Minoru from ICC Japan and more will attend the Open studio event on the day of the exhibitions' opening. By giving introduction of the artists' works and mentoring program SNR would like to provide an opportunity to the residency artists to develop networks. SNR also expect to achieve art historical research on media artists and share archives of each institutions in addition to becoming a change to develop SNR's international network.  Analog Welcome Digital Archive Daewon Hwang Curator Alternative Space LOOP   Concepts and roles of archive are changing and stretching along with the development of digital technology. Archives find themselves in front of an unprecedented task as computer files replace stacks of paper or reels of film that used to serve the purpose of documentation and storage in the past. As concerns a new dilemma over technological gap between old and new materials for instance a fresh perspective will be drawn from saving and reproduction of digital files or preservation and sharing of documentation which have become easier than ever through the Internet. When it goes to visual art digital archive transforms approaches to the form of video art in particular not to mention its contribution toward the preservation of various publications and images produced on the occasion of each exhibition.  	Analog Welcome Digital Archive is an exhibition based on the participation of nine leading institutions that represent the field of media art or video art. Participants from each institution submitted two media works selected from their own archive according to historical significance of an artwork in relation to the archive or the situation of video medium after the 1960s. This show exemplifies a new phase of video art exhibition enabled by the emergence of digital archive. To elaborate video has now become available to be transmitted as DVD or media file and shown in any locality in a quality equivalent to the original without visiting relevant institutions via airplane or transporting film from one location to another.  	Even so despite the considerable development of technology an exhibition of exchange is still not easy as one may think especially when the items to be share between institutions are video “works.” As Bernhard Serexhe one of participating curators pointed out during the preparation of this show it is a mistake to assume the right to disclose something to everyone in every site simply because it is “digital.” An artwork protected under copyright is supposed to be prohibited from arbitrary distribution and each organization adheres to a different set of rules concerning the operation and release of digital archive. Therefore invigoration of an archive exchange project requires constant meetings and discussions which are the part that cannot be comforted by digital technology. Add to this the exhibition itself that presents moving image to the viewers is a place governed by the physical restrictions of space and time filled with heavy equipment. Although art archive goes digital it is analog on which inviting everything to one spot heavily relies.  	Analog Welcome Digital Archive is an experiment devoted to sustainable archive sharing projects in the future. The charms of video works featured in this show speak for the reason that all sorts of actual and analog labor are necessary to archive sharing. The essence of archive resides in the preservation of documentation which in turn is one of the most basic forms of history. Chosen with particular attention to the term “history” the works participating in this exhibition carry monumental meaning as preserved material alongside their primary meaning as art. Whether it is an old black and white film or a recent record or a social practice or a silent performance these videos allude to stories saturated in artistic image. They are not only documentations of the long gone past but also scenes that we should not be able to run into if materials were not stored. There still remain new things in the past. It is the encounter in the present not old memories what archive exhibition welcomes.

Since artists are evaluated through their artworks museums consider the trend of the times and intention of artworks to induce visitors. Through such processes artists inevitably feel responsible for or attached to their artworks and such thoughts strengthen the affinity between artists and their own work.   This exhibition displays artworks whose relationship with their artists is no longer meaningful or significant when presented to viewers. It means that such artworks are freed from artists’ attachment and responsibility. It is like a monument that has forgotten what to commemorate. Such monuments are taken down or disposed of depending on how a person or a historical incident is assessed in certain context or circumstances. When monuments lose their originally intended purposes of commemoration however they can also be reborn as an independent object. Artworks have similar features. Artists create an artwork with certain intent at the time of its creation; when they no longer feel responsible for the artworkor they can no longer agree to it for various reasons however artworks can finally exist on their own.   Such artworks which are strictly separated from their artists can have new meaning through the interaction with the viewers even if there is no comment about their creators. The captions of exhibited artworks or exhibition catalogues do not provide any information about the artists. Due to the strict anonymity of artists viewers can only communicate with the artworks. Whether viewers like certain artworks or show no interest in them such feelings or emotions exist only between viewers and artworks. What makes an artwork truly an artwork is not the artist who created them but the viewers who appreciate them. ■ Beak Jung Ki ","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192845_2dbd1670c040440fa1be90eb01ba4f19_7e9aca47f91141b58809048947e2153e"

The sounds of winds birds insects electric poles power plants and automobiles which we can easily hear on the surface of the landfill as well as the sounds of vibration and wavelengths which are generated from physiological and chemical reactions happening inside waste dumps below the surface of ground help people associate the present structural frame of Nanjido with its past.  The primary attempt of <INSTANT LANDSCAPE> is to express physiological and chemical reactions which are generated by wavelengths vibrations frictions gas and leachate from the surface of upper structures into exhibition spaces by turning them into sounds through electronic devices. With various sounds collected from the Nanjido site an attempt is made to re-interpret the ironical historical duality and structural irrationality of the lower structure 'waste dump' and the characteristics of the upper structure of the surface which works as a park from the perspective of our society’s widespread phenomenon of cover-up.  To remind people of the upper surface and lower structures at the exhibition space the sounds from physiological and chemical reactions are delivered through speakers and vibrations and sounds are expressed in an overlapping mode by using soil as a medium which symbolizes the surface of the ground. In addition the images of Nanjido village which were accidently captured by the artist during the early winter of 1996 help people recall Nanjido which used to be a garbage landfill and a historical space which was isolated from society in the past. They also derive people's interest in Nanjido as a space of possibility and value when the sounds onsite are juxtaposed.■ KIM Joon  ","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192845_7c6fda931801444f9b4473aab5f5ce62_6c51306acd1344cc9b6350fd2bdbf1b9"

Children are children because they have dreams. As long as they continue to have dreams they will remain children; and because they dream within their dreams they are children.

As part of its efforts to materialize the ‘Post-Museum’ vision SeMA is opening the Project Gallery as a space for alternative and experimental contemporary art and holding Video Fever: Screening Live Performance and Talk organized by the Media Collection of SeMA to commemorate the new gallery’s opening between July 30 and September 1 2013. Video Fever: Screening Live Performance and Talk will present the familiar medium of videos which were introduced as a mass media vehicle in the ‘40s and ’50s and have been widely used in various fields of our daily life. Videos only began to be established as an independent art genre in the late 1960s. Compared to traditional media video art depends more on technology and has been developed into various formats along with the development of technology. This program generally introduces video art and its development by screening the single channel videos of the four world-famous artists and it aims to widen viewers’ understanding of video art.   For the screening four video works are selected among the media collection of SeMA ‘Point of View: An Anthology of the Moving Image’(2003) which contains the works of the eleven world-famous video artists as well as interviews on the process of video art production. The program presents single channel video works by a number of artists including Gary Hill who investigates videos as a new form of writing in the relationship between words and electronic images; Joan Jonas who chooses videos as a means of expressing her performance; Pipilotti Rist who raises questions about sex the female body and gender differences in modern society through aerial music and the installation of projected images; and Isaac Julien whose work as a performative documentary tells stories about self-identity (black and gay) and creates a new space via multi-screen projections. Along with the showing of the single channel videos interviews with internationally known curators Dan Cameron and Hans Ulich Obrist will be presented in order to assist visitors’ understanding of the artists and their works. With the works and the interviews there will be additional programs prepared such as live performances of emerging artists and talks on video art in order to examine the meaning and influence of video art in the context of contemporary art.   <Live Performance> 6pm Tue 30th July  / 6pm Sun 18th August  Site-Specific Uh 800/40  <Talk> 4pm Wed 7th August  From Video Art to Expanded Cinema ?

It adds interpretations of the three artists which seem contradictory to each other such as the provision and evaluation of value praise and rejection fear and indulgence. It is an attempt at drawing the world of slow motion tinted by humiliation and shame as well as an attempt at depicting paradoxical scenery which can be referred to a “speed battle” and which only face each other in a hollow boundless space seemingly never forming any relations. ■ Jung Sungyoon ","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192842_cd464e00a0c84eb3bb03a21afb8fa935_e3faf14480cc411fb853fc36baf08f00"

Artist Kim Ku-lim was born in Sangju Gyeongsangbuk-do in 1936. He did not have any formal art education but has led the activities of such groups as Painting 68 A.G. Group and the 4th Group leaving important footsteps in the history of Korean avant garde art by developing his own unique artistic style. In addition he carried out genre-transcending creative activities that created huge reverberations in the Korean art arena during the 1960-70s focusing on painting and sculpture as well as happenings installation art mail art body painting land art and experimental movies.  The exhibition titled SeMA Green Kim Ku-lim: Like You Know It All will show some experimental artworks by artist Kim Ku-lim from the 1960s and ’70s.

Then we look around us to find yes the person we have expected. But a sign is not always right. Sometimes we can find no one.  Sometimes a human shaped statue creates the similar aura that human does. Does that aura indicate a spirit inside? It maybe exist or maybe not. I named such a sense of aura created by an object “Mulgicheok (its presence)”. Like a human shaped statue I think the object which moves or changes like a robot can also create that kind of aura. That is why this exhibition is filled with media art works showing their own movements sounds and lights. All of art works are arranged densely in a small space. Compared with other exhibitions where the boundary between works is clearly defined this exhibition may appear like a busy room packed with crowds. Such layout i s aimed to help the audience feel the signs of objects’ presence (aura) more keenly.   Imagining the audience invited to a room filled with living objects I designed exhibition halls to appear like living rooms and art works to appear like furniture or household objects. And because there are two divided exhibition halls I designed them to create contrasting atmospheres with each other. SeMA NANJI Exhibition Hall 1 for instance is designed to help the audience feel the objects’ presence (aura) physically. The exhibits in this hall include <Movement Project> by Kwon Yong-Chul which is designed to move with mechanical muscles <Sans Titre> by Jung Seung marked by a buzzing hair dryer and <Noise Box_No. 0> by Suk Sung-Suk consisting of a TV set and a disassembled radio placed on a desk. On the other hand SeMA NANJI Exhibition Hall 2 is designed to help the audience sense the object’s presence (aura) virtually. There are <CAVE into the cave: Between> by Lee Ye-Seung featuring moving shadows cast via a projector <Noise Box_ DalSeong Park> by Suk Sung-Suk characterized by TV images put in a bag and <Liquid Crystal> by MISUNG presenting video ornaments.  The only common element of these works from five different artists is that they are media art. These works are however fill the entire exhibition halls together with their presence combined and strengthened by amalgamation of different sounds lights and movements.

Paul Gauguin was a leading Post-Impressionist artist and an important figure in the Symbolist movement. His artistic style led directly to the Synthetist style of modern art and also influential to Fauvism German Expressionism Cubism and Abstract Paintings in the 20th century art. In the 21st century still remains the Paul Gauguin’s artistic heritage in contemporary art.   SeMA explored the spirituality of Gauguin works in 'Voyage into the Myth' as well as his historic-stylistic achievement in his art. Linking and harmonizing the 21st century contemporary art with Gauguin’s masterpieces this exhibition will offer an interesting opportunity to experience various meanings of “Paradise” in contemporary art after Gauguin. The works produced by Marco Brambilla and five other contemporary artists visually interrupt the flow of Gauguin artworks and vigorously generate the senses of radical vision and symbolic logic the same artistic virtues found in Gauguin artworks.  60 Gauguin artworks including Gauguin’s tri-masterpieces 'Yellow Christ' 'Vision After the Sermon' 'Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?' have rarely been shown altogether in public throughout the world. 'Gauguin and After: Voyage into the Myth' will give audiences a breathtaking experience to meet the powerful Gauguin masterpieces.

He creates in this way diverse futures diverse times which themselves also proliferate and fork. …'  (Jorge Luis Borges (1941) from The Garden of Forking Paths)    This exhibition began from two points that are unrelated to each other. The unique composition of the gallery which is part of the SeMA NANJI RESIDENCY (SNR) has become in itself the format of this exhibition. The gallery used to be a wastewater processing facility but it was renovated into an empty space upon the construction of SNR. The space consists of two independent circular spaces forming a pair of near-perfect symmetrical spaces. Such symmetrical structures provide the first clue about the exhibition. They were designed so as to co-exist without hierarchy or to contradict each other. The name of the exhibition The Roads of Forking Paths which instantly reminds people of a concrete scene was adopted from the title of a well-known short story The Garden of Forking Paths written in 1941 by Jorge Luis Borges. In this story Borges suggests a multi-layered time structure which encompasses all possibilities. The artists participating in this exhibition planned a pair of symmetrical artworks that contradict each other or repeat themselves or run parallel to each other or complement or conflict with each other or are dislocated or multi-faceted or are disintegrated or co-exist. Here parallelism does not simply pursue a formative parallel but refers to two possibilities of the same weight which are separated from one thought. Through this process the artists decided to support a format and content that are related to each other or run away from each other as they embrace the possibility of errors which may evade perfect rationality.   Under a given situation viewers should understand the exhibition as they actively visit the two spaces. However it is impossible for them to see the two spaces as a whole due to the characteristics of the space so they can only see a disconnected fragmented view. An integration of such views occurs in the brains of the viewers in different time lags. It is similar to presenting two sides of a coin which cannot be seen simultaneously but it allows viewers to actively derive all possible conclusions. Through this different times evolve simultaneously like parallel universes which exist in different dimensions within the same time zone.   We are all aware of the unavoidable boredom we may experience in the midst of an easygoing comfortable life. This exhibition presupposes that experiences with discord and enmity which evolve from the intermixture of dissimilar elements can move our thoughts to an area where things of the past have not been realized. Such discord or multiplicity could be one of the basic conditions that prevents our life escaping the magnetic field of discord absorption or dislocation owing to the expansion of modernity even though we live in the 21st century.   The artists participating in this exhibition support the notions of ambivalence compatibility contradiction and conflict. When our life accelerates along a straight line we often imagine other lines which do not easily harmonize as they exist in the margins or below or above. Within a tight net of time which disperses converges or goes parallel the lines divide into two parts limitlessly. At this exhibition two circular spaces which are symmetrical tie two forces running in separate directions into a single tension and they become a place which mediates simultaneous forces stretching out in four directions unnoticeably. Moving to a different location will depend on the viewer's free will. ■ Kim Ayoung  ","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192842_f01e71d9343c468a8ce7b08248f1a40d_3f8ae819b5154f448bd363f5f83aac93"

At that time many theatrical stage plays were produced around Europe but as film screening gained popularity establishment of a multi-purpose theatre that could put on plays and films was being attempted. Technology that creates space by integrating technology and all fields of visual art such as architecture painting sculpture design etc. in order to study stages and produce theatrical spaces is an expression of civilization and culture and it is also in concert with the expression of thought.   Total Theatre: Interspace Dialogue an architecture exhibition and film festival borrows Gropius and Piscator’s concept of a new kind of theatre to realize a cinema inside of the white cube of a museum. Especially by renting mass-produced industrial materials or receiving defective products which were sorted out and discarded during the production process from sponsors attempts were made to adopt recycling or upcycling a term that became a social issue of our time to building structures. Added to that by using different material properties taken from ordinary industrial products from our everyday lives such as forklift pallets plastic chairs that are used in events felts that are used as dust covers at construction sites and bicycle tires viewers’ tactile experience of stage devices rather than simple visual experiences were induced.   Off and Free International Expanded Cinema and Art Festival program partner of Total Theatre will be showing artistic and experimental pieces with a selection of 64 films under the title Interspace Dialogue. Off and Free International Expanded Cinema and Art Festival turning 5th this year means to get off existing commercial film system and become free from box office profit. It is a not-for-profit organization whose purpose is to extend the field of film as a total concept that meets changing times to discover non-commercial film that are original and of high quality and gain transparency in running a film festival.   As a pre-biennale to the biannual Seoul International Media Art Biennale Mediacity Seoul the largest event held by Seoul Museum of Art Total Theatre: Interspace Dialogue through a combination of experimental films and buildings that were designed under the concept of ‘flexible buildings and theatres that are capable of transforming and refreshes the mind by its spatial impact’ is a challenge for a new form of exhibition and also an exhibition that actively reflects the post-museum vision of Seoul Museum of Art.   ■ Bilateral Theatre by KOOK Hyoung-gul  Bilateral Theater is a space that is opened to both sides. Audiences who are spread around the bilateral projection screen sit to gaze at each other. They watch films and they watch whoever's there on the other side. Under such arrangement free and without any sense of direction the audience may take whatever position that's most comfortable for them.  Kook is an American registered architect and assistant professor at Ewha Womans University in Seoul and works as an architect. As an architectural designer at Weiss/Manfredi in New York Kook has earned a wide range of experience including structure installation to urban and landscaping project.   ■ Plushscape by Max Kuo  Plushscape is an immersive installation which seeks to agitate and amplify the somatic conditions of the viewers’ bodies providing more spatial possibilities in their haptic response to the screening films. The installation design consists of nodal points created from bolts of bujikpo that are woven into soft seating pouches and then attached to a rigid frame. These spongy nests allow for group lounging in a variety of positions and also serve as vertically peaked features within the gallery.  Max Kuo is a founding partner in the networked architectural design collaborative ALLTHATISSOLID and His award-winning firm has engaged in built and conceptual proposals throughout the U.S. China Korea and Maylasia. Currently living and practicing in Seoul Kuo is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Architectural Design at Soongsil University.  ■ Society of Architecture by Imponderabilia  Imponderabilia is placed in a crystal room and bolts are used in a way that more and more emphasizes the narrow and high form of the room. Materials that make up the structural type of the bolt are 350 mass-produced and rentable parasol chairs. By transforming the method of piling the parasol chairs were born again to an architectural element which has a certain volume.  Founded by Yerin Kand and Chi Hoon Lee in 2010  SOA place their focus on discovering and comprehending various architectural and urban themes and goes on to develop and experiment with spatial systems materials methods of construction and building types of many different constructed environments varying in size from buildings to cities.  ■ Interspace by Interface by OH Sang-hoon Interface has two meanings: the boundary between two kinds of systems or devices that are combined and the space in between interspaces. Interspace by Interface uses space and waste tires to show the phenomenon of a change of relationship that results from the death of an object.

Focusing on the Korean Japanese Artists in 2013 as part of the Nationwide Municipal Museums of Art Network project which was planned during the 1st meeting with the directors of municipal museums of art in response to the need for various exchange projects and exhibitions to strengthen the functions of public museums of art. As part of the first project eight museums of art including the Seoul Museum of Art will hold special exhibition tours. This exhibition will evoke fruitful interpretations of the Ha Jung-woong collection which belongs to five municipal museums including the Gwangju Museum of Art by allowing each museum to reorganize their exhibition. This project is largely based on exchange and collaboration between the various museums of the network and has great significance in that it aims to open up communication between the researchers of the museums. This network project will help re-establish the role and status of public museums of art and exercise considerable influence on the construction of infrastructure including the re-organization of the museum system and the professional workforce. This project will be carried out every year. As part of another project of the network the Jeonbuk Museum of Art is planning to hold New & Now: SeMA’s New Acquisitions 2012 an exhibition of the Seoul Museum of Art’s new collection of installation works and sculptures in May.  The first special exhibition tour is to be held at the Seoul Museum of Art  Progressive Art in the Turbulent Era ? Focusing on the Korean Japanese Artists   The Seoul Museum of Art's exhibition titled Special Exhibition of Ha Jung-woong Collection “Art of Prayers” will show aspects of the early modern and contemporary history of Korea and Japan from the perspectives of both Korean-Japanese and Japanese artists. The exhibition will be held for 27 days under the title Progressive Art in the Turbulent Era ? Focusing on the Korean Japanese Artists. In relation with this exhibition seminars will be held on May 15 (Wed) at the SeMA Hall under such titles as ‘Exploring New Directions for the Network Project’; ‘The Use of the Collections of Museums of Art’; and ‘The Value and Significance of the Ha Jung-woong Collection’. The exhibition has been conceived to shed light on Korean-Japanese artists who have generally been neglected in the history of Korean and Japanese art. It will focus on works of realism excluding mono paintings and take a look at life during the historically turbulent period from the viewpoint of ethnic minorities and particularly that of Japanese artists and Korean-Japanese artists. The Ha Jung-woong collection which is possessed collectively by the Gwangju Busan Daejeon Pohang and Jeonbuk Museums of Art mainly consists of works which emphasize the social participatory function of art. His collection will provide a great opportunity for visitors to see the memorable heritage of that time through works left by Japanese artists who had sound awareness of history as well as artists of the Korean diaspora during that period.   Traces of History Legacy of Memories  The exhibition titled Progressive Art in the Turbulent Era to be held at the Seoul Museum of Art will present some 100 works by 11 artists selected from among the works of the Ha Jung-woong collection belonging to the Gwangju Museum of Art. It consists of two sections. The first section Traces of History will consist of works that record and report aspects of human life during the early modern and contemporary history of Korea and Japan; while the second section Legacy of Memories will highlight the social function of art from the perspectives of ethnic minorities (including Koreans) that live in Japan. Traces of History which are footsteps left behind by human life influence our present consciousness as a heritage of abiding memories rather than disappearing among our buried memories. The themes and contents of the works are inseparable from the main issues of human life.  By exhibiting works by Japanese artists and Korean-Japanese artists who lived through a turbulent period of history this exhibition will provide an opportunity for visitors to see a different viewpoint of the time shared by Japanese artists and Korean-Japanese artists which characterizes the Ha Jung-woong collection. The first section Traces of History consists of photos of the dancer Choi Seung-Hee; Hanaoka Story a collaborative work by three Japanese artists namely Nii Hiroharu Takidaira Jiro and Maki Daisuke; and lithographic works by Tomiyama Taeko. The second section Legacy of Memories exhibits works by Kwak Duck-jun Kim In-sook Song Young-ok Chun Hwa-hwang and Cho Yang-gyu who portrayed the life of that time from realistic trends. Visitors to the exhibition will be able to see how artists strove to offer a window into their own era and implicitly expressed the politics economy society and culture of the time in their works.

The 17th Invitational Exhibition by the Seoul Intangible Heritage Preservation Society to celebrate its opening.  This event celebrating the opening of the Living Arts Museum consists of two categories traditional handicrafts such as lacquerware onggi (brown-glazed pottery) making decorative knot making needlework and wood furniture making and traditional alcoholic beverages representing the cultural heritage of Seoul. The event is participated by 23 masters of Seoul’s intangible heritage who have committed their lives to the preservation and development of the traditional culture. The fine works of living arts displayed in this event are expected to provide viewers with a rare opportunity to experience remarkable talents of great artists and some of the essential features of Korean traditional culture.  This exhibition is aimed to guide the art-loving public to that the traditional craftworks displayed here are not just relics of the past but practical works of art taking roots in the daily life of modern people. That is why the museum introduced new ideas and techniques of modern design to the way the objects are exhibited.  Living Arts Museum will continued to present exhibitions of living arts which include handicraft design fashion and architecture and grow into one of the Korea’s top institution of its kind according to the strategy “to create local cultural hubs and specialized spaces.” The SeMA plans to turn its affiliates into local cultural hubs committed to specialized themes. According to the plan the SeMA’s Main Hall in Seosomun will be grown into a center of global cultural networking the Nam Seoul Museum of Art into a main stage for handicrafts and design related with our everyday life and Buk Seoul Museum of Art into a public art complex friendly to the local community. This spatial specialization effort is expected to help the SeMA better adapted to the tendency of modern art moving towards expanding the boundary of art and trying to meet diverse demands from various rungs of society.  The organizer hopes that this opening show of the Living Arts Museum will play an important role in the SeMA’s effort to grow further via continuing to present exciting exhibitions of handicrafts design fashion and architecture.

Museum’s collection is a fundamental factor which not only establishes the identity of the museum but also functions as a medium of communication between viewers and art institutions. To strengthen such meaning and enhance the quality of SeMA we adopted a new collecting policy beginning from last year. This new policy aims to maintain balance of the collection by medium genre and period while at the same time building a comprehensive and characteristic collection which would differentiate us from other institutions.    To meet this goal we have acquired a total of 198 pieces over two times last year. In order to keep balance between genres proportions of (public) sculpture installation media works have been increased and important pieces in art history were partially added to the list. Also with the aim of emphasizing contemporary characteristic of art inspiring the will to create and setting up an upright art market we focused on living artists in the field especially those who are domestically and internationally active instead of those who passed away.   < New & Now : New Acquisitions 2012 : > is composed of 39 sculptures and installations taken from our last year’s acquisition. In order to overcome the spatial limitation of the exhibition hall on the 1st floor we confined our selections to 3 dimensional pieces. However as we have concentrated on two specific genres sculpture and installation we expect this to work as an opportunity in magnifying the aesthetical inspiration for the viewers. Paintings and media works that are not displayed in this exhibition will be presented at our next special exhibition for the opening of SeMA Buk Seoul which is planned for July this year.   Museum’s collection has its meaning in influence and educational effect it delivers to the viewers as opposed to mere asset value of the artworks. It is in this respect that we may appraise the special value of exhibitions featuring museum’s collection which intermediates between artworks and viewers. Especially as it is implied by the title <New & Now> this exhibition declares a new beginning of SeMA’s collection sending the message of SeMA’s will to communicate with its viewers and to spread and share ongoing contemporary art.   Furthermore SeMA is seeking to start its practice of display education and promotion anew. To break from existing customs and the rigid system of museums and to become a social museum paying attention to the public viewers citizens and community as well as a multi-functional museum that places emphasis on fusion and convergence instead of a single value we are developing various programs in accordance with our vision to become a ‘post-museum’.

The contemporary artists included in this collection have been highly active in numerous fields of art including calligraphy design and fine art etc. This exhibition explores the changing aspects of contemporary Hangeul through the work of artists with unique work styles and perspectives.   Regardless of the medium this exhibition is comprised of three sections each looking at the development of Hangeul since its inception from the age of paper and pen to the digital age. The first section <Hangeul as Art> exhibits work transformed from the unique shape of Hangeul. The second section <Hangeul as Inspiration> introduces Hangeul as a raw material of creation. The last section <Hangeul as Interaction> presents art inspired by the principle of Hangeul and its invention. As a whole the work demonstrates the ways in which modern times might accommodate Hangeul ? as a sound as a form and as a meaning.  The first section <Hangeul as Art>on the first floor outlines the beauty of Hangeul based on its raw materials ? the sky the earth the humans ? through the unique work of the calligrapher and the graphic designer. On the second floor the second section <Hangeul as Inspiration>examines the beauty of Hangeul as characters and its structural formation through investigation and an experimental approach; this allows us to witness the harmony between the calligrapher graphic designer and dancer. As a result by combining body costume and poetry the second section transforms the various figures of Hangeul in its present age into an art. The last section <Hangeul as Interaction> foregrounds the personality of Hangeul as sound equaling image and allows the opportunity to witness the beauty of this alphabet due to its aesthetics and scientific principles.    The exhibition is made through the interaction of artists with diverse backgrounds; it enables us to experience the beautiful variations and to broaden our understanding of Hangeul. We hope this exhibition highlights the aesthetic sense of Hangeul’s past and present and also provides creative direction for the future of Korean art.

The term “Art Archives” refers to materials with lasting and permanent value among the record materials which have been collected or created by art-related agencies. As the year 2012 is the 10th anniversary year of the opening of the Seoul Museum of Art at the former location of the Supreme Court this exhibition brings great meaning in that it shows the museum’s intention of constructing archives. The title of this exhibition was named “2012 SeMA Archive: Looking Back and Forward” because it will provide an opportunity for visitors to see and understand the intrinsic characteristics of archives. The exhibition “2012 SeMA Archives: Looking Back and Forward” consists of materials related to artists who have participated in SeMA exhibitions particularly two representative exhibitions of this year held by the Seoul Museum of Art: “SeMA Youth 2012: 12 Events for 12 Rooms” and “SeMA Gold 2012_Hidden Tracks.” The portfolios of artists contain artists’ vita notes and records about the concept of their artworks artwork-related images critiques or artists’ own writings which show the art world of each artist. In addition original sketches and drawings as well as catalogs and videos about individual and group exhibitions are on display for visitors to see the process of art creation of each artist in a single viewing. History is not preserved on its own. The history of art museums is somewhat the same. Human memory has limitations in remembering all the fine exhibitions and educational programs that have been offered for the public. This exhibition is held to preserve such history which might otherwise disappear from our memories and the elements of such history that lie in artworks and artists. Another objective of this exhibition is to provide a foundation for constructing a systematic archive system. This is a public declaration announcing that the construction of archives will be an ongoing activity beyond just a one-time effort.

The exhibition will showcase new media artworks in which various genres such as architecture media and sound are realized. The exhibition will serve as a venue for overseas artists based in the UK Belgium Japan Australia and India as well as for five Korean artists to present their new works under the theme of ‘Artificial Garden’.  Notably this exhibition will present early photos and nineteen drawings by Haus-Rucker-Co. widely recognized as a pioneer of avant-garde architecture in the 20th century together with Archigram for the first time in Korea. Haus-Rucker-Co was founded by the artist Klaus Pinter and architects G?nter Zamp Kelp and Laurids Ortner. It does not limit the scope or activities of its works which range from architectural design to performance art to a particular medium or form. Furthermore it endeavors to actively disseminate the concept of ‘temporary architecture’ or ‘disposable architecture’ which predicts changes in the environment early on. Forest (2012) by Indian artist Ranbir Kaleka shows fancy time and space that transcend reality based on the odd characteristics of the combined media of painting and video but the plot of the art consists in reporting reality mainly focusing on existential problems such as the problems of migratory workers or the life of Indians from the perspective of the artist’s own experiences.   Media artist Yangachi creates artworks that decipher the political economic and cultural codes of the digital environment and network systems of the past ten years. Currently he is planning to present <A Gathering of Testicular Cancer Patients> (2012) which is an installation and performance work based on storytelling practices.   Garden in the Air (2012) is a sound art installation work by KWON Byungjun who is well known for his indie band activities such as “Pippie Long Stocking” or “Wonder Bird”. It is a real-time work of art in which programmed sound is performed through sixteen speaker channels by a light sensor. This work of art is completed by elements that vary depending on time and space such as space sound and light.  Light Tree (2011) is a work of interactive media art by HYBE (Han Changmin RyuSunwoong) who won an award at the Da Vinci Ideas Competition of Seoul Art Space GEUMCHEON. It will be exhibited together with Floating Garden (2012) which is an installation structure designed by architect and Professor Kook Hyoung-gul (Ewha Womans University). Professor SeoHyojung (sadi) is a first-generation new media artist who is still working actively. During this exhibition she will present her works of art which were created as part of a project to assist the recovery from earthquake damage in Japan.   Japanese media artist Taka Hiro Matsuo Belgium’s famous media art group LAb [au] and the UK’s sound designer and media artist Sophie Clements will also present works based on ‘dreamy’ light and sound that respond to the movements of visitors.

"000169","Joo Myung Duck: the beginning and another beginning","","Nam Seoul Museum of Art","2012-10-10","2012-11-25","","","","","","Photos","100 pieces","","","The exhibition titled Joo Myung Duck: the beginning and another beginning will be held to commemorate the donation of works of art by Joo Myung Duck (1940~ ) a master of Korean photography and to shed light on his creative world. The Seoul Museum of Art received a donation of 76 artworks in 2011 directly from the artist who is perceived as a living witness of Korean photography. For this exhibition the museum has selected fifty pieces from his first documentary photo series titled “The Mixed Names” as well as fifty pieces from the artist’s collection.   Retrospective exhibitions are usually held for veteran artists who have dedicated their entire life to creating art. However this exhibition will display artworks from a series of documentary photos from the 1960s when the artist took his first steps as an artist as well as a series titled “The Abstract in Photography” which is an ongoing project. This exhibition will attempt to show how artist Joo Myung Duck’s caring vision of the world has been realized and how it has changed from the beginning of his career to the present.    This exhibition will comprise five sections namely “1966 The Mixed Names” “1968 Yongjugol” “1971 Uncheon” “1963~68 Seoul”  and “2011~2012 The Abstract in Photography” in order to show the landscapes of places captured by the eyes of the artist.  The sections titled “1966 The Mixed Names” “1968 Yongjugol” and “1971 Uncheon” feature different places from different times but they all use the Korean War one of the most painful chapters in Korea’s history as the background.  The section “The Mixed Names” is a series of documentary photos produced around 1966. This series contains photos of abandoned mixed-race orphans who were conceived by foreign soldiers fighting in the Korean War and Korean women. It has great significance in that it was Joo Myung Duck’s first work to concentrate on realism in his career. Through these artworks the artist raised social issues related to mixed-race orphans who by 1966 had been neglected for fifteen years based on the facts and records contained in the artist’s photos. In his subsequent series of artworks such as “1968 Yongjugol” and “1971 Uncheon” Joo continued to express issues concerning mixed-race orphans recording them in photos during his visits to US Army bases which were symbols of the divided nation.  The series “1963~68 Seoul” consists of works which record certain social aspects of that time primarily by capturing daily scenes as they were happening in various corners of Seoul in the 1960s. The scenes captured by the “caring eyes” of the artist succeed in depicting the sensibility and personal stories of the characters in his photos and as such are much more than mere objective photographic records.  His recent series titled “2011~2012 The Abstract in Photography” consistent with his early works contain daily scenes captured from the contemplative stance of an onlooker. The subjects featured in the series “The Abstract in Photography” which remind people of artworks of abstract expressionist or post-painterly abstraction include the sea and sky seen through windows; fences covered with graffiti; traffic lanes; and old cracked and chipped painted walls. These trivial scenes which we can easily see all around us were closely captured in time and space by the artist and transformed into abstract forms which no longer contain concrete stories.  These scenes which capture the vicissitudes in the lives of ordinary people who went through difficult times in the past or others which suggest the dark side of society used to draw out instantaneous sympathy but now they have been transformed into scenes that induce limitless thoughts without suggesting or coercing anything.

So far Mediacity has been introducing new and exciting interdisciplinary practices of media art drawing on influences of contemporary science philosophy and new technology. Now reaching the 7th edition the biennale aims to show a multitude of interests that captivates the world of contemporary media art today. The 7th Seoul International Media Art Biennale will open from 11th September ~ 4th November 2012. The theme of this year’s biennale is ‘Spell on You’. This proposes to imagine a vision for a new world and society in two ways. On the one hand it will show how the recent production of new technology and social media is generating various renewals in social communication and exchange. On the other hand it aims to reinterpret art and technology in an attempt to re-envision our future and find alternative ways of living. Against this background this exhibition will highlight the notion of a ‘Spell’ to convey active and direct modes of communication. It is hope that ‘Mediacity’ can bring an illuminating insight into the current dynamic shifts in contemporary art and technology. ‘Spell on You’ brings together works by approximately fifty artists from all over the world. Jinsang Yoo is the artistic director of the 7th Seoul International Media Art Biennale and he will be joined by three renowned curators of contemporary media art; Yukiko Shikata (Independent curator based in Tokyo) Olof van Winden (Director of Netherlands Media Art Institute NIMk) and Dooeun Choi (Former Creative Director of Art Center Nabi/ Co-curator of The Zero1 festival at San Jose).  About Mediacity Seoul 2012 “Spell on You” ‘Spell on You’ proposes to explore the overpowering influence of a spell encapsulated in the song ‘I Put a Spell on You’ by Screamin’ Jay Hawkins an American blues singer and songwriter. This exhibition will question the wider technological means of utilizing the media in the 21st century and expose the current social and political contexts in which the recent phenomena of Social Networking Services such as Facebook Twitter and YouTube have globally surfaced the Internet. The exhibition brings together new and recent works by approximately fifty international artists from all over the world.   □ Seoul Museum of Art  1F Media Theatre : Everything Will Be Alright  The entry to the exhibition on level one begins with 'M?moire' a video piece by Adel Abdessemed. This part of the exhibition introduces the scope media and narrates stories of conflict and confrontation crisis and challenge voyeurism and spontaneity. In an attempt to make sense of contemporary media and technology a variety of works unravel the overwhelming spell of technology through critical as well as poetic visual interpretations.   2F Thousand Spells : On Transmigration of Unknown Friends  Social networking websites such as Twitter Facebook and YouTube drastically changed the world that we live in today. Technological advancements led to the mass distribution of information and opinions which instigated a new kind of democracy as well as economic instability.   3F Crosstalking : Invisible but 'Hello'  The exhibition on level three elucidates how contemporary art productions aim to go beyond the purpose of showcasing new technology. Instead they explore human empathy in order to escape from feeling invisible which has become a normative part of modern life. It can be said that the notion of ‘invisibility’ manifests from the overwhelming sense of being subsumed by technique which leads to fear and alienation.   DMC Gallery  Patterns of Cloud : Getting to Know What The World Feels  The technology of data collection and analysis began from military technology which moved on to develop applications that enabled private conversations and emotional exchanges. As a result better communication and network systems are creating more room for exchanges. At the same time the capital and authority of technology increasingly risks being intrusive to our own private spaces.   □ Participating Artists  Adel Abdessemed Marina Abramovi?

Human anxiety continues due to natural disasters diseases accidents and punishment. Paradoxically modern societies are being maintained by such feelings of anxiety therefore accordingly a kind of catastrophe can be expected in the future of modern societies. Artists are people who have well-developed sensibilities rather than rationality so they excel at sensing signs of catastrophe. They sense these signs early on and express them as art. Through artists’ artworks that show the origin of anxiety and the signs of catastrophe visitors will be able to diagnose the diseases of the modern society and examine how such diseased phenomena can be dissolved in the process of catharsis through art.    ■ This exhibition is held as part of a cultural exchange between Korea and Japan. It will serve as an opportunity to revitalize cultural exchange between the two countries and to promote the globalization of the Nanji Residency which is being operated by the Seoul Museum of Art. In accordance with the theme of this exhibition Korea selected representative artists among artists from the Nanji Residency whereas Japan organized artists by concentrating on Hiramatsu Nubuyuki who is a participating artist and an exhibition planner.

This exhibition concentrates on the beauty of abstract painting with a view to helping visitors develop a closer relationship with abstract painting which can be perceived as obscure and difficult to understand due to the absence of concrete shapes on the painting. A long history of meaning has been accumulated since the beginnings of human culture with specific colors representing similar emotions across disparate cultural areas and acquiring contrasting meanings according to their local use. As the meaning of colors is strengthened or diversified depending on space and time color has become a part of group unconsciousness and an important symbol of human life. Colors are directly connected to our deep unconsciousness so we can communicate with each other intuitively and the analysis and understanding of art works will follow naturally through the immediacy of shared feelings. Enjoying and accepting such an abundance of perceptual and psychological stimuli can be a meaningful way of appreciating works of art. We hope that this exhibition will further visitors’ understanding of the history of each one of these artworks as well the artistic and social context in which they were created through deep communion and close experience with them.","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192839_7e44caabeba24269a33446be4c8db6c3_7c47a9503a5c4ec187139faf5c67d115"

A ‘hidden track’ is a bonus song or piece of music included somewhere on a music album without being included on the playlist of the album. The name came about because musicians often edit several bits of incomplete works and include them after the last track of their album with no title. The ‘hidden track’ which exists in an untitled form amid hit songs new music and completed songs takes various forms such as a piece of unpublished music or noise providing listeners with an opportunity to appreciate each musician’s unique sonic world. For musicians a ‘hidden track’ provides a moment of fun excitement and freedom in the process of making a regular album and at the same time gives an unexpected ‘surprise’ to the general public. I proposed these characteristics of the ‘hidden track’ to the nineteen veteran Korean artists participating in the SeMA Gold 2012 exhibition. Is there a way that we can prolong the art world of artists who are in their 50s and 60s and who have devoted themselves to the artist’s life for more than twenty or thirty years? How should we reflect on these artists’ long journey into their fully developed artistic world? How can we display their passion for art? And how do they react and respond to the current art situation? The exhibition Hidden Track is then the process by which our invited artists all of whom are in their 50s and 60s attempt to answer these and other similar questions. This exhibition will consist only of the ‘hidden tracks’ of veteran Korean artists and will serve as an ‘unusual venue’ where the general public can appreciate these artists’ journey and passion as well as their unique ideas. Amid the familiar works well-known styles and representative artworks of these artists these ‘hidden tracks’ will create a special ‘moment’ for the general public helping visitors to the exhibition to reflect on the works of these artists who have been with us for more than 30 years.    Viewing Points  This exhibition consists of ‘hidden tracks’ by the participating artists. As such it represents a new form of group exhibition which will create more fruitful narrative through unexpected conflicts and confrontations between the works on display.

A member of the National Academy of Arts Min Kyoung-kap is a senior artist who has developed a distinctive style unparalleled in the realm of Korean painting.    For the past sixty-odd years Artist Min Kyoung-kap has single-mindedly walked on the path of Korean painting and created a unique world of his own combining the traditional features of 'Korean painting' with modernity that does away with the drab uniformity of previous 'Eastern painting.' When fine artists in Korea were actively engaged in group activities in search of breakthroughs in the early 1960's Min co-founded the mugnimhoe (Black Ink Forest Society) an avant guard group unprecedented in Korean painting and led the 'modernization' of Korean painting by introducing abstraction into the genre. As a young artist full of vigor he was a major force behind the refreshing evolution of Korean painting shattering the traditional conception of Eastern painting with daring visual experiments in style such as nonrepresentational and semi-abstract paintings.   Since then with Western painting growing by leaps and bounds the artist began to wonder about the identity of Korean painting namely 'what can Korean painting offer that Western painting does not?' His lifelong quest to find answers to this question continues to this day. He saw that the path of Korean painting lies in expressing the sentiments and spirit of Koreans through Korean media and this thought of his has been accompanied throughout his life by the theme of 'Nature.' Returning to representational paintings of realistic scenery in the early 1970's the artist began to take nature as his main subject matter. His contemporary landscape painting with the theme of 'Nature' symbolized by 'the mountain' has been an ongoing process in which the portrayal of nature's outer appearance is transcended to capture the world of spirit that seeks oneness with nature. Under the overarching theme of 'Nature' through a series of works such as 'In Harmony with Nature' in the 1980's to the early 1990's 'Coexistence with Nature' in the mid to late 1990's 'Into Nature' in the early 2000's 'Non-Doing' in the 2000's and 'True-Such' in the 2010's the artist has endeavored to find the fundament of his artistic world and the spiritual archetype of Koreans in the attitude to seek harmony with 'the Way of Nature' an invisible flow in which creations and dissolutions take place naturally and without any artificial technicality.  Artist Min Kyoung-kap has strengthened the characteristic features of Korean painting by holding on to the use of the traditional materials of hwaseonji (Korean painting paper) muk (black ink) and natural pigments and by continuously pursuing the theme of 'Nature' in expressing the sentiments and spirit of Koreans who seek oneness with Nature. While carrying on the traditional features of Korean painting he has created pictures with organic compositions some in abstraction and others in representation and has developed distinctive colors of Korean painting with clarity and depth that get beyond those of oil painting. Min is still on his ceaseless journey searching for the way of his art as a painter of Korean painting and for the identity of Korean painting asking Nature the Way.

This exhibition will shed light on aspects of artworks by young contemporary artists who are actively working at home and overseas in various genres. Amid a situation where the boundaries of art itself as well as the media and genres of art have become blurred this exhibition will provide an opportunity for visitors artists and the art museum to communicate with each other and appreciate a new flow of our art by providing a space in which young artists can freely think and explore.   This exhibition of works by twelve young artists will encompass every field of modern art including painting video photography installation art and sound. The works on which the young artists are currently concentrating are the theme of this exhibition. Accordingly twelve events which will be held in twelve rooms will show the current direction of each young artist and the exhibitions displayed in twelve rooms become one connected exhibition revealing diverse aspects of Korean modern art as created by young contemporary artists. The twelve rooms of the twelve artists are each successively connected with each other while serving as twelve independent stages on which a unique artistic incident occurs and each room serves as a scene to form one big stage within the topology of contemporary art.  The new form adopted by this exhibition is designed to shed light on artworks by young artists through its open composition. It will serve as a venue which generates points of discussion about contemporary art as well as future development by enhancing the public’s understanding and appreciation of the meaning and diversity of modern art.

Appendix: Tarmac  <Introduction> (by the Earth from Above Organizing Committee in Korea) This special exhibition of The Earth from Above of Aerial photographer Yann Arthus-Bertrand is comprised of 220 photographs and video images selected from those that the photographer has collected for more than 20 years. The photographs will make you feel as if you have been to outer space and become a mature citizen of a global village. Children will marvel at the beautiful and wonderful shapes of the Earth viewed from the sky while senior citizens may be tempted to look back at their past which is in some ways painful and some ways delightful. The event is prepared as a special feast for everyone who loves art culture and self-reflection. The photographer started the grand project The Earth from Above in 1993 with a passionate resolve for recording images of the Earth based on the thought that everything lacks transparency. However he is still on the Earth. In October 2011 Yann was photographing the scenes of ideology-laden massacres of people flying in the Congo sky which has been filled with gun smoke for the past 40-plus years. Mother nature was displaying her wonderful sight regardless of what was going on between hostile people.   ? 1. The Earth from above ? The images of the Earth This is the first time that the photographer ever displayed his selected photographs in public. He is like an angel proposing that we change the paradigm of civilization in the 21st century from God’s perspective. 7 billion people on the Earth have their own life stories. He is like a bird with God’s perspective overlooking delight sorrow or heartbreaking scenes occurring on the Earth.  -An exhibition that combines photography with criticism on civilization and a love of the Earth The exhibition is “special” in several respects. You will see how great each displayed piece is. There is no need for an explanation. What make this exhibition special is that the photographer shows everything about the world. He traveled to more than 130 countries in the world over 20-plus years and his photographs contain various scenes of the world. His photographs include documentary film-like photos; abstract painting-like photos and even destroyed Buddha images in Bamiyan Cave Afghanistan. You can say that his photographs are unique as they show everything that can be expressed by art in one photo. Henri Cartier-Bresson was the master of fine art photography. Magnum Photographers are focusing on photo-journalism. Yann’s photographs combine fine art photography and photo-journalism into one thus opening a new area of photographic art.  ? 2. The Korea from above ? Rediscovery of Korea Another factor that makes this event “special” is that it is a Korea-focused event. The Earth from Above Organizing Committee in Korea has worked together with Yann over the past 10 years. The exhibition was prepared by the Committee including the planning and composition of the displayed items. The Committee made painstaking efforts to make the event a success paying attention to every detail to ensure that every one of the displayed items is aligned to a level of understanding for both experts and lay people. It is also noteworthy that such meticulous preparations were made in collaboration with the photographer over an extended period of time under the supervision of former Cultural Minister Lee Eo-ryung. Mr. Lee Eo-ryung says that the exhibition is an artistic event that displays the conversion of the civilization paradigm in the 21st century like a harbinger. He wrote the foreword for The Korea from above and an essay for photographs of Korea included in the exhibition. The exhibition is “special” as it is presented as an event containing storytelling. The event aims to share what the photographer saw with the people of the global village. In addition to seeking the most sublime form of art the event invites visitors to a land of enticing storytelling. It is expected that visitors will have an interesting experience feeling that the “there” contained in the 200-plus photographs is “here” after all and then “mine.” Even the contents of the event are Korean-specific. There are many uniquely beautiful things in Korea (you heard that Jeju Island was chosen as one of the New Seven Wonders of Nature by the New7Wonders foundation in Zurich Switzerland didn’t you?) but many of them remain unknown to foreigners. It will be a pleasant experience for visitors to look at the 30-plus aerial pictures of the country selected from 20000 photographs taken by the photographer over the past 6 years.  ? 3. HOME (Moving images of the DMZ in Korea opened for the first time)/ A film made by Yann Arthus-Bertrand   ? 4. Animals other friends of ours/ Good Breeding/ Horse  - An opportunity to look at ourselves through livestock humankind’s oldest friends Here you will listen to the words exchanged between people and livestock such as horses cows pigs sheep etc. They are duets of love and dialogue between people and livestock as contrasted with the culture of our times in which people treat animals harshly and treat other people like animals.  Livestock have been close friends with humankind. Animals including those appearing on the Altamira Cave paintings and the Dangun Myth of Korea lived together with people. It is not an exaggeration to say that people created civilization with animals in the pre-industrialization era. Roman Empire and Ghengis Khan’s empire for example could not expand their sphere of influence without horses. Just as horses symbolized nomads so cows symbolized farming settlers. With the advent of the industrialization era animals turned from humankind’s everyday partners to those simply grown to meet people’s requirements. Pets are the opposite side of the foregoing story. The photographer has taken pictures of animals associated with humans over the past 20 years and animals play a crucial part in this exhibition. His photographs of animals are a wonder themselves. They are life hymns for animals. Perhaps they are a declaration of animals’ rights. It is said that animals take after their master's characteristics. Yann’s photographs seem to confirm it. The photographs show that communication is carried out between the animals and humans. They seem to tell us what it is like to raise plants and animals (perhaps like raising children?) and what life is. Yann’s photographs let the Earth and animals have their say and their voices made in unison will make visitors look at themselves.

In the midst of heavy traffic busy people a building jungle and bustling streets the Nam Seoul Annex Building appears somewhat aloof and indifferent about Seoul’s hectic daily life. The beauty of its unusual red-brick architecture and well-adorned garden attracts the attention of visitors to the gallery. This exhibition was planned to suggest an imaginary space to visitors who might have wondered “What might be happening in here?” while standing in front of the building. As soon as visitors walk through the black steel gates and inside the gallery they will enter into a new world that is quite different from reality. This unfamiliar Nam Seoul Annex Building has become a place that stimulates visitors’ curiosity ? it is a place full of imagination. The exhibition consists of four parts which will allow visitors to form a sequential story depending on their viewing circulation: “Entering” “Lingering” “Being Lost” and “Meeting.” Visitors will be able to experience mystical things where exhibits are on display within several rooms that are arranged like a maze. This exhibition was specially planned for children and students’ winter vacation. It will provide a great opportunity for them to enjoy artwork that is not limited to a certain genre of art or the history of art. In the coming years Seoul Museum of Art will make its best efforts to hold exhibitions of its collections so that visitors can more easily enjoy modern artwork.

Choi Duk Hyu was a painter who pioneered a new style of naturalism an activist who worked for Korea’s independence during Japanese colonization and an art educator who opened a new horizon of landscape painting. In 2007 the Seoul Museum of Art received 78 pieces of his valuable oil and watercolor paintings that were donated by the family of the artist. This exhibition will showcase a total of 45 pieces of his representative works which include 29 pieces from the donation 13 pieces from the collection of the Choi Duk Hyu Memorial Hall and 3 pieces from the collection of the National Museum of Contemporary Art.  Painter Choi Duk Hyu (1922-1998) was born in Hongseong Chungcheongnam-do in 1922. He dreamt of becoming a painter under the influence of his art teacher Chang Bal during his second year in Whimoon Middle School in Seoul. Between 1941 and 1943 he majored in Western painting at the Tokyo Teikoku Art School (now Musashino Art University). It is well known that his activities with the Gwangbokgun (Korean Restoration Army) had the greatest influence on his painting throughout his life. During his schooling at the Tokyo Teikoku Art School he was assigned as a student soldier to the 64th Division of the Japanese Army and was stationed in Manchuria. During that time he barely succeeded in escaping from the army. In 1945 he joined Gwangbokgun as an independence activist and fought for Korea’s independence from Japan. In 1950 he volunteered to enlist himself in the Korean Army during the Korean War fought against North Korean forces and was discharged from the army as a lieutenant in 1956. Painter Choi Duk Hyu was an artist of Western painting who developed a new painting style of naturalism and he was also an art teacher who devoted his life to fostering new artists at Kyunghee University as he sublimated his passion for art in the battlefields.  This exhibition will systematically shed new light on major works of art by painter Choi Duk Hyu which were created between the early 1940s and the mid 1990s. It will display 38 pieces of oil painting and 7 pieces of watercolor paintings such as “Musasino Farm” “The Streets of Washington” “Five Colors of Red Pine Trees” and “Jeongreung and Miari.”  His works of art that were created between the 1940s-1950s attempted a new naturalism painting style as a nonrepresentational abstract natural expression. As a whole they were realistic but partially remind us of Fauvism. His colors also concentrated on creating a beautiful harmony. During the 1960s-70s when he was active internationally his artistic sense of colors demonstrated his internal change as a matured artist very well. During the 1970s-80s Choi Duk Hyu showed a strong affection and attachment towards Seoul and painted the scenic view of Seoul intensively. He was like a recorder of Seoul’s change by creating a series of masterpiece works. Among his landscape paintings of Seoul where his lively brush strokes and abundant colors were expressed a series of paintings describing the forest of buildings of Seoul which has now grown to become an international city show off the city very well.  This exhibition of Choi Duk Hyu’s art works has been specially planned to pay tribute and express appreciation for the donation of his works by his bereaved family and it intends to raise the public’s awareness about the culture of donation through this event.

Through two to three times of open application processes every year the museum acquires artworks in a wide range of genres and by an extensive scope of artists which allows to trace a possible genealogy of Korean contemporary art. The museum concentrates on establishing its collections showcasing the spectrum of contemporary art rather than focusing too much on a specific period movement or artist. As the result of its endeavors since 1988 the museum holds a total of 3131 pieces as of September 2011 encompassing works by established artists who have gone down in Korean contemporary art history as well as works by rising artists.

The museum purchases valuable works two to three times a year across all categories and artists to avoid the acquisition from being too partialto a particular group or trend. The acquisition must portray the direction of contemporary art. From1988 to September 2011 Seoul Museum of Art has collected 3131 pieces ranging from masters that passed away to bright new stars on theirway to accomplishing Korean contemporary art history.

This year’s event is focused on all kinds of nature- or human-caused disasters that devastated communities all across Asia dealing with a range of socio-cultural issues disrupting the urban environments in context of dystopia. The event is also aimed to lead viewers to pay closer attention to misfortunes around them and find measures to handle them via contemporary art. This year’s event City_net Asia 2011 invites artists recommended by curators from major art institutions not just from Northeast Asia but Southeast Asia as well and presents works handling local issues in the context of the dystopian reality. The event is expected to offer visitors an opportunity to look at the situations surrounding many local cities and reactions and attitudes of art towards them via the entire spectrum of viewpoints toward geological and political disasters and strategies to survive them.  This year’s exhibition is participated by leading art institutions in four Asian cities the 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art in Kanazawa Japan the Jim Thompson Art Center in Bangkok Thailand Ruangrupa in Jakarta Indonesia and Seoul Museum of Art in Seoul Korea. The event is expected to offer art lovers an opportunity to ponder on various issues many Asian cities face today and will in the future. The various viewpoints the artists have towards the today’s Asian art and urban life will help viewers have a rare artistic experience.   #1. Seoul Natural disasters can strike us anytime and any where. We witnessed Seoul severely hit by flood last summer and the Sungnyemun Gate a symbol of the city burnt down. Likewise suicide spreads like an epidemic killing several thousand Korean people from teenagers to the elderly every year. Silent Conflict is conceived from that great disasters are caused by contradictions and conflicts immanent in the systems formed in the guise of order. It aims to look into the hidden side of the contemporary world in which disasters are consumed as spectacle images. The disasters left scars behind them which have a profound influence upon the physical mental and psychological aspects of the human society. The repressed conflicts and hidden contradictions in our society can lead to an explosion when the time is ripe leaving a lasting impact upon all its members.  The works in this exhibition deal with various social and political issues although there is no direct slogan about them. The artists try to make a statement about political incidents through individuals sacrificed by political systems guiding viewers to the social cultural and psychological scars left to individuals by the total power.  #2. Jakarta Disasters always leave us some material and spiritual damage or loss. In an urban context the word ‘disaster’ has a broader and more complex meaning related with damage or loss incurred by ignorance of design and policies. In the Indonesian cities the source of ‘power’ is no more God bureaucrats or business policies. The will or authority of God or Nature may be invisible but is powerful infinite and even unpredictable in most cases.  In the works sent for this exhibition Ruangrupa artists focus their attention on people’s survival tactics in the midst of disaster one sweeping a city in particular. The subjects of their works include damage and loss in an urban environment and experiment renovation and sustainability in accordance with social systems and bureaucracy. The exhibition is expected to show how we ordinary citizens set up and operate tactics to survive in all the destructive forces generated in an urban environment and what strategies and tactics artists and designers develop to tackle such situation.  Visitors to the exhibition will be guided to a great variety of approaches and views on survival in an urban environment researches on survival strategy mapping efforts to create a new space from the ruins of an old space sustainable design and how individuals and groups in a city manage loss damage and dream.  #3. Kanazawa A massive tsunami combined with powerful earthquakes hit the Japan’s northeastern region on March 11 2011. The natural disaster led to the collapse of a nuclear power plant in Fukushima whose tragic outcome still attracts worldwide media coverage and heated debates all across the world regarding the scope and aftermath of the disaster. The Fukushima nuclear disaster woke us to two questions: What should we do to handle the new “daily life”? What terrible wrongdoing have we been engaged in and still are? The questions demand us to reconsider basic ethics and norms of behavior. We are now fallen into a trap of dismay of pain and trying to flee from the chaos for a breathing space.  We have been held on to the myth of “development” from the belief that the development of science and economy would bring happiness to us. Market economy has exerted a strong influence upon us and we have been effectively hidden from the serious problems and dangers immanent in it. Today we need to find a ‘force’ that can help us get over through art the 20th century studded with tragic incidents and imagine something new. We need to show through art strengths and potentiality with which we can stand again after directly facing disasters such as the one that hit Fukushima. At the same time we should handle the emotional wounds and pain in a careful thoughtful manner. Modern art is not an activity remote from daily life of human beings. We as modern people can find harmony of life and meaning of existence through art.  #4. Bangkok  This exhibition is aimed at investigation and analysis of the cause and outcome of the disasters troubling Bangkok and Thailand. The disasters bringing fatal outcomes to this city are not caused by nature but humans poor infrastructure socio-economic environment resulting in grave inequality and political conflicts. As in many countries of the Third World disasters striking Thailand are largely caused by chronic political instability and the conflict between the traditional value and the effort for modernization. The title “Bang-kok 2011” shows a wordplay regarding the current urban situations in which a political conflict results in disruption among its citizens. The exhibition is focused on the social and political disruptions of last May that left a deep scar to the citizens’ memories. The key question is related with a virtual or imaginary world related with the city of Bangkok and the question: “Where is this city originated where is it today and where is it heading for?” With the question the works in this exhibition deal with urban landscapes and situations in which people deal with the reality they are situated. There are also works focused on the virtual or imaginary conditions and a way to look at the real world which is beyond what is fabricated by the state and the media. These works are key witnesses of the modern society and culture and people’s agony trauma and terror about the uncertain future.

It will shed light on the images’ rhetoric which induces communication with the public thereby generating social meaning.  The works to be presented at the exhibition have been carefully picked from among pieces that can be immediately recognized as figurative “images” with a view to eliciting discussion about what each of the fourteen artists are trying to express to the audience and what methods they have chosen to do so. This exhibition is composed of artists whose ages range from the forties to the sixties so all of them have spent twenty thirty or even forty years in the field experimenting with aesthetics and with variations throughout their career. Some may have settled for a specific method of expression others are still on their way. Instead of categorizing the works by theme or concept the exhibition is composed in such a way that the artists’ track can be followed through from start to finish.  In other words this exhibition is an extensive study on master artists who are now pillars of the Korean contemporary art scene. Not only will the exhibition reveal to us the current whereabouts of our art but it will also give us an idea of where it is heading.

Participating artists have been chosen from among the artists the Seoul Museum of Art has so far supported and who have taken note of the problem with images that is visibility. The exhibition aims to showcase the dynamism and diversity of contemporary art.   As the media environment becomes more diversified people live in a flood of images produced and consumed that seem more real than reality. In today’s society dominated by images everyone has the experience of perceiving the image per se as reality through its continuous reproduction. While able to sense the gap between what we see and what we know between images and reality we live without appreciating this. This show intends to examine aspects of contemporary art that will make viewers aware of this gap through the works of rising artists. Like a mirror reflecting objects rather than seeing them as the subject our eyes react to images. As an illusion a painting transferring an object to a two-dimensional surface is based on the premise that it deceives the viewer’s eye.   Part 1 The Strange Mirror: Chasm between Images and eye presents artworks that engender visual effects through the use of various devices and experiment with new dimensions of illusion in a playful manner. This section introduces work that generates optical illusions by employing a variety of mediums such as video photography and electronic devices. Part 2 Treachery of Images: Chasm between Images and reality poses questions concerning our imperfect perceptual system the social system’s influence on this and the relationship between the visible and invisible through works revealing the chasm between what we know and what we see imagery and reality. These works clarify that an act of seeing or the imagery itself is coded discovering a variety of desires and contradictions derived from coded images.   The show intends to shed light on various issues related to images such as reality and imagination individual and system and representation and entity. Along with this the museum has planned the Chronology Project Interview Project and Research Project with participating artists to get a sense of young artists’ thoughts and anxieties in our age and to have an opportunity to stimulate communication between the museum artists and viewers.

Thematic organization to easily understand Chargall’s art ? 1 I and the Village Russian Period 1910-1922 In Russia Period an adolescent Chagall painted his indigenous life and dreamy ideal.

Illustrated prints based on classics such as Four Tales from Arabian Nights  Daphnis and Chloe  and Fables of La Fontaine  are on view.  Chagall’s Art World painted by Love The most distinguished artist in the 20th century Marc Chagall was a Jewish French born in Vitebsk Russia. During his long 98 year-life he tried nearly every medium: oil paintings prints wall paintings stained glass stage sets and murals and ceiling paintings in the huge structures such as Opera Houses and museums. Above all Chagall was a transformative artist. He developed his unique romantic style in combining his childhood experience when living in the Jewish village and his imagination and in accepting strong colors from Fauvism and a new idea of space from Cubism. Like most avant-garde artists Chagall was able to transform the genre color and form in changing and overlapping various art genres. Chagall’s art so childlike and mysterious that is not categorized in any other contemporary art genres deeply influenced on the birth of Surrealism. Like he said in his autobiography that “I didn’t have one single painting that didn’t breathe with the sprit and reflection [of Vitebsk]” the everyday-life motif of flower animal the folklore of countryside village bride and lovers appear in free forms in his canvases. Also Chagall who frequently paints fairy-tale-like world country life and lovers flying in the sky left us beautiful works like dreams such asI and the Village (1912) Over the Town (1914-18) and Promenade (1917-18). The pieces of his memories and imagination acquired through his long life were incised in the domain of vision―in his canvas―surpassing the domain of time. Chagall’s works show his pursuit of passion and love through his entire life and his unique color in a dreamy world.

From 1985 to 2003 the exhibition displayed the works of representative doyen artists of the time across diverse types including Korean painting Western painting print and sculpture. Since 2004 the works exhibited in the event have been divided into several categories including painting sculpture handicraft and print. Such an arrangement was aimed at providing a more professional insight into each category and drawing attention to often overlooked categories.   The main focus of this year’s event will be modern Korean “sculpture.” In particular this year’s event will not categorize work according to traditional formality or historical classifications such as representational or abstract but will adopt a comprehensive approach that illustrates various aspects of modern Korean sculpture. The invitation of artists was decided through meetings of the Exhibition Advisory Committee as part of the effort to secure maximum fairness and objectivity and the works were selected were among the most recently produced to give a the clearest picture of modern Korean sculpture.   Since today’s art world is characterized by a blurring of the borders between genres and many attempts to fuse media are taking place what can be included in the genre of ‘sculpture’ is not clear either. Furthermore the features of sculpture such as material choice 3-dimensional formation and the relationship between artwork and space give the genre a greater potential for expansion than other genres.   In order for the exhibition to contain not only traditional sculptures but also those embodying new and diverse concepts the planning process started with the simple premise ‘contemporary modern Korean sculpture’ as its one and only guideline. Such an approach embraced various types of artwork that were created as ‘sculptures’ by the artists in question and thus avoided the limited stereotypical view of sculpture. In this manner the exhibition through its 65 sculptures has been able to best demonstrate the evolutionary trends in Korean sculpture. In addition to the traditional sculptures there are many pieces that were created using non-traditional sculpture formats installations and media. These include mixed-genre sculptures pieces using new media that as yet have not been categorized as traditional sculpture materials and installations that illustrate uncertain conditions.

To connect with the rest of the world we invest a certain amount of trust in various relations. Trust is by default an ambiguous notion it is one grounded in good faith as much as in doubt. As individuals we not only have these relations to our fellow citizens but also increasingly with modes of connection. With proliferating forms of media information comes to us in many guises and the message is more and more opaque; marketing poses as friendship solitude as community populism as democracy. Instead of simply stepping up to the speed of technology the curatorial team of Media City Seoul 2010 proceeds from a desire to pause reflect and critique the transitions and transformations of our social contexts. The exhibition is propositional by nature. Trust interprets media broadly?as a tool for engagement within a shifting terrain where political national or religious identities are being re-charted; where means of distribut ion creates real and imagined communities; and where private interpersonal space share the same platform as global political issues of the day. As forms of media become more accessible and varied we enter an era that seemingly allows more room for self-expression and individuality. Yet what is at stake when media channels are more concentrated and powerful? How do these networks create new spaces of alienation and control? How do we reconcile the desire for changing social models with a desire for new communities? The exhibition works against the rhetoric of technology as progress and promise offering instead a recalibration of its definition. Many of the artists in the exhibition are not known as media artists but use various forms of media (printed material urban detritus photographic and video technology documentary and fictional forms) to counter the generalizing of experience by dominant narratives. Trust investigates notions of community representation and perception in a world that is continuously being retold and reconfigured. In this light how are stories histories and myths construed? How is collective experience represented through multiplicity and difference? The exhibition emphasizes artistic practices that play with documentary conventions fictional forms espousing for imagination subjectivity and localities as underpinnings of contemporary experience. Sometimes revealing the underlying constructs of mediated stories and at other times obscuring them. Trust does not aim to meticulously dissect the matters at hand or present a scientific or intellectual study of our current mediascape. Instead Trust offers a broad interpretation of media and invests in a humanistic and individual response to contemporary experience.

The aim of the exhibition is to provide visitors with a new perspective on the MOA’s collection through its careful selection of Korean paintings that reflect the trends and recent innovations in this area.   The “Korean Fantasy Painting” exhibition the very first of its kind displays a selection of high-level Korean paintings from the Seoul MOA’s collection that are based on the aesthetic consciousness and mood of Korea yet visualized in very contemporary forms along with borrowed witty pieces in a similar context. Given the fact that the works of veteran mid-level and new artists who have steadily been striving to express their individual colors and worlds rather than simply imitating and responding to traditional visuality are being displayed together in the same space this exhibition is considered as being truly significant and valuable.   The exhibition is divided into the two sections according to the subject matter. Section I Variations of Landscape Paintings is located on the first floor and introduces art based on traditional landscape paintings whilst reflecting the artists’ own colors. Section 1 displays some traditional sumie landscape paintings by Byeon Gwan-sik and Kim Eun-ho as well as representative pieces of 1st generation Korean painters after liberation. Such painters developed their own painting methods based on traditional methods. Also featured are mid-level artists with a more abstract and intense style who were taught by the 1st generation artists and young artists brimming with the spirit of experimentation. The presented selection of work allows the viewer to note the trends Korean landscape painting has followed over time.   Section II Daily Lives of Modern Men is located on the second floor and presents the diversity of daily life for a modern man as expressed using very Korean media paper writing brushes and ink sticks. The dry and prosaic surroundings of modern men in particular city men have long been an inspiration for many artists. Section II displays work created from various perspectives and approaches including a face full of trouble reflecting the times a work that pursues abstract spirit expressed through human and a work that follows the faces of modern men from an unusual perspective.  Through these meaningful and interesting works viewers will be enticed into the wide and deep world of empathy that the artists have spread before them. As always the artists are concerned with maintaining a deep and close bond with the public. In addition we hope that this exhibition will serve as an opportunity to bring back what ‘Korean characteristics’ means upon ourselves. It is also expected that the Seoul Museum of Art will attract the attention of residents students and citizens by providing a new kind of experience with its specifically themed Korean painting collection. One that has never been seen before.

The exhibit also serves to explore the contribution by forty-seven contemporary artists from home and abroad who were deeply influenced by Man Ray’s photographs and his artistic spirit. The exhibit is divided into three sections under three different themes to look into Man Ray and the contemporary artists influenced by him.  The first theme is photography as a record of reality. Portraits fashion photos advertisements and documentary photographs fall into this category. Even though photographs seem to rigidly imprison the outlines of whatever they capture the images taken by camera are not merely simple traces. In photographs historical social and political happenings are recorded in the artist’s unique style.  The second theme is photography emphasizing the subjective creative and inimitable. If the purpose of photographs is not objective or commercial photographs can be much more experimental. The unique techniques and technologies of photographs open new doors for artistic expression. Additionally photographs allow us witness the accidental or things not seen in a conventional manner.  The third and final theme is the world of fiction and imagination. These photographs bring to life fantasy worlds using photography-unique techniques not employed in reproductive photographs. These techniques include double printing solarization retouching shaking restructuring of frame and Rayogram. The photographs exhibited under this theme unashamedly embrace more flexible modes of artistic creation.

The exhibition displays products created by modern art and product brands and artists’ works that have been incorporated with the concept of products.  The attempt to mix fine art with popular culture and industry by an art museum however is not new. The collaboration between artists and brands an increasingly popular trend today is becoming a way to promote artists’ works to the public and for brands the collaboration enables them to create a higher value. In other words such collaboration between modern art and products has become an important axis that forms the world of the artists’ works.  Artists of the 21st Century leap beyond the 20th Century-style production of pop art which considered the artists’ work room as a “factory” as so named by Andy Warhol that manufactured products that would satisfy the desire of consumers in a mass consuming society. Their work is based on a concept of “production” which brings to mind a type of small-and-medium size enterprise. They are created in a systematic way through phases such as creation production marketing and promotion to step closer to the public through large-scale collaboration. In addition well-known artists often operate online and offline stores to sell art products and items that they create. Downtown department stores design their outer walls with artist’s projects or display their products along with art pieces to cross a boundary between their products and sophisticated art.  Yet together with the assessment that this is a strategy to find a point of interaction with the public or that it is a new form of pop art criticism that modern art has been degraded to a peripheral part of a product and controversy over mass production and the uniqueness of art works continue. Twelve teams of artists and designers take part in this exhibition in a bid to study the diverse thoughts and artistic attitudes toward this phenomenon. They deliver a message to society by becoming an artistic brand and exhibiting a popularized piece of work or as a form of vandalism using products stickers logos and graffiti to convey their determination on their ideas and ‘change’.  Through these works which are journeys to discover new artistic values with a pop art or activism attitude we hope to examine how modern art is being applied in different fields and the appeal of modern art as a product. The exhibition will identify new ways to approach the general public and expand the scope of artist’s work through the work of modern artists that break down walls dividing artistic works and products and communicate with the public.

Thus visitors will have fun whilst improving their appreciation of art. In addition this exhibition along with the special exhibition ‘RETROSPECTIVE RODIN’ to be held in parallel will present the physical energy of sculptures from diverse viewpoints.  This year’s theme ‘FANTASY FAIRY TALE’ will allow visitors to become a fairy tale hero and to travel through a world of fantasy inspired by the surrealistic artwork of a type only usually encountered in their imagination. A fairy tale is a story for children involving magical events and imaginary creatures not bound by time and space. However the moralistic lessons embedded in the narratives of fairy tails are not limited to children. The exhibition intends to provide visitors with a fun and relaxing atmosphere where they can enjoy the arts in the open and fresh air.  As a visitor is ushered into the museum to a fresh green esculent scent he or she becomes a hero or heroine of a fairy tail and starts a fantastic journey. Not only children but also adults who are accustomed to treadmill-like existence will feel a shiver of excitement as soon as they take the first step into a world of fantasy. Artwork which is stationary yet seems to be moving dynamically located along the pathway of the museum talks to visitors. The exhibition would like to give visitors the chance to broaden their viewpoints toward objects through such dynamic and fantastic pieces.   The works express the themes of fantasy whilst maintaing their realistic aspects. Their lyricism through poetic fantasy and new perspectives which balance realism with fantasy will take us on a voyage deep into our imagination.

As an extension of these successive events with great anticipation and excitement we would like to invite you to the upcoming extravaganza “Rodin: Retrospective.” A must-see event dedicated to the world-famous sculptor Auguste Rodin the exhibition will be held at the Seoul Museum of Art from Apr. 30 to Aug. 22 2010 in collaboration with KBS (Korean Broadcasting System). Rodin who has been praised as “Michelangelo Reincarnated” or the progenitor of modern sculpture successfully converted lifeless materials into sculptures imbued with delicate human feelings such as passion agony love and hatred. He accomplished the process passionately and emotionally and indeed kept same attitude to his private life. Surely his art can not be interpreted without knowing the artist’s personal relationships. The love affair with his pupil Camille Claudel often depicted as complicated but ardent love is even understood as a part of his genius. As a consequence Passion and Love are the key elements that fulfilled Rodin’s affinity for art. One of the Rodin’s biggest accomplishments a historical change to the period of radical upheaval in the late 19th century art. He upgraded the status of sculpture that had long been downgraded to a decorative public monument since the Renaissance to a higher one an independent place where only pure and creative works can stand. In the process of questioning and answering ‘what made Rodin a great sculptor?’ his talent and artistic originality are the chief elements to be emphasized. These two keywords not solely earned Rodin a world-wide fame but also enabled him to realize the idiosyncratic harmonization of both composition and abstraction especially shown in Balzac. With his dynamic sculptures the combination of body and soul in human figure Rodin is still extolled as a pathfinder and precursor of modern sculpture. As a first retrospective of Rodin in Korea this exhibition offers a unique opportunity to gain a thorough insight into life and career of the artist who is second to none in modern sculpture. Here visitors will meet what has Rodin left behind works executed in pursuance of realizing not solely the human figures but also the realm of God.

This exhibition was organized to commemorate the donation of his work by the renowned artist. The exhibition will highlight the broad range of his artwork from that of his early period to his most recent works. Born the son of the painter Oh Ji Ho ? a pioneer of Western-style painting in Korea - Oh Seung Woo received special recognition in Korea’s National Art Exhibition at the age of 27. He went on to join the ranks of prominent recommended artists when he was 31. Since then Oh Seung Woo has left a prominent mark on Korean art. He was given the Seoul Culture Award and served as president of the Mokwoohoe Fine Arts Association.   In this collection you will see paintings from each distinctive time period that focus on distinctive themes. Indeed this artist liked to dwell on a single subject for a long time before moving on to the next one. For every subject that he chose to explore he would dig deep into that subject. This enabled him to pursue his quest into the hidden cultural and spiritual contexts surrounding his chosen themes.   This exhibition will feature all of Oh Seung Woo’s 60 representative works. On show will be a series of paintings on the themes of ancient relics a flower and girl mountains and the 10 traditional symbols of longevity. The exhibition which also commemorates the donation of his work by the artist will be a valuable opportunity to see first-hand the artist’s entire oeuvre from his early works to his more current ones.    In the painter’s early years he travelled around the country’s many Buddhist temples and chose images of Buddha and Buddhist scriptures as the subjects for his canvas. Many of his paintings from this period received special acclaim in the National Art Exhibition. His choice of subject was not only influenced by his family ancestry but can also be seen as his own personal journey in search of his roots. Later in the 1960s his paintings began to explore a fantasy world far from reality where flowers and girls became the center of his artistic world. In the 1980s Oh Seung Woo travelled around the country’s mountains to put them on canvas. His work during this period expresses the inner most corners of his home country and reflects his awe for nature. In the 1990s he traveled around neighboring countries such as China Thailand Vietnam and Myanmar to transpose the energy of ancient relics onto his canvas using strong vivid colors and powerful strokes that were ‘like roaring flames’. The fascination he had for fantasy during the 1960s returned to him in his later years in the form of the 10 traditional symbols of longevity. Such recent work reveals a transfiguration of tradition and modernity into a new spirit of the times. Dwelling on a single subject for extended periods of time gave the artist the freedom to pursue his deep quest for the origins of culture. The artist also digs deep into his own personal roots from where he constructs his own unique artistic world.   Art critic Oh Gwang Soo points out that “the common thread in Oh Seung Woo’s artwork is nature and culture.” He adds that such themes of nature and culture are “part of a past heritage that is reborn in the context of our current times.” This in fact is a distinctive trait of Oh Seung Woo’s art. This exhibition covering the artist’s early to more recent work is a valuable opportunity to join the artist in his anthropological journey in the quest for the origins of culture.   ▣ The Structure of the Exhibition  The Oh Seung Woo exhibition is divided into different time periods each with its own distinctive theme. This exhibition will be an exciting opportunity to view his entire oeuvre and see how his interests and styles have evolved with each stage of his life.   1. Ancient Relics and Folk Culture of Korea  The work that won special recognition in the National Art Exhibition was painted in the artist’s early years between 1957 and 1960 and dealt consistently with Buddhist scriptures and temples. His choice of subject matter can be interpreted as an exploration into the origins of culture rather than a simple expression of Buddhist faith. During this period the artist reproduced images in a relatively realistic way expressing cultural energy and cultural roots with distinctively bright and powerful colors. Through influence from his mother’s side he traveled around the country’s many temples where he became mesmerized by Buddhist structures and images. This journey into cultural origins found its way back into his work in the 1980s in his choice of folk elements such as traditional ox fights and mills in his many paintings portraying the traditional life of common people.   2. Flower and Girl  In the 1960s Oh Seung Woo gradually broke free from his realistic depictions of nature to explore the world of fantasy. After his series of paintings of relics he went on to paint a series of works on fairies in a fantasy world that revolved around a flower and girl. The ‘Flower and Girl’ series was mainly painted in the 1960s. Compared to the ‘Relics’ series which employed a strong and clear color contrast the ‘Flower and Girl’ series gradually incorporates white for a softer use of color. His dream-like portrayal of plants animals and people set against a mystical background seems to have led naturally to his next theme ? the 10 traditional symbols of longevity. In the ‘Flower and Girl’ series Oh removes all concrete forms from the background which is depicted as pure color to strengthen the image of the fantasy world.   3. Korea’s 100 Mountains The ‘Korea’s 100 Mountains’ series was painted in the 1980s. In this series Oh Seung Woo not only painted mountains but impressively portrayed the inner most part of his homeland. Mountains are not subjects in themselves. Rather in Oh’s paintings they are there to express the energy of the territory. The artist rendered 130 mountains on canvas including the famous Baekdu Mountain Sorak Mountain Jiri Mountain and Halla Mountain. Oh guides you to the inner most flesh of the mountains rather than just focusing on a three-dimensional contrast of distance. Thus his mountains are actually symbolic mountains growing in the wilderness of his imagination.   4. Original Forms of the East The ‘Original Forms from the East’ series was mostly painted in the 1990s. In this series of work we see a rampant use of flaming colors. Always in the center of a painting is a temple or a palace. The artist portrays centers of civilization and history in their most glorious forms. He traces the centers of civilization not only in China but also in the surrounding Eastern countries to express the splendor of Eastern culture. Temples and palaces are valuable in understanding Eastern civilization as the former is the center of spiritual and cultural life and the latter the center of secular power. The artist’s explorations into the temples relics and towers of India China Dunhuang Japan Thailand Laos Myanmar Vietnam Nepal Tibet Indonesia and Malaysia are energetically reflected in his paintings.   5. 10 Traditional Symbols of Longevity Oh Seung Woo began work on the ‘10 Traditional Symbols of Longevity’ series in the new millennium. Unlike his past ‘Korea’s 100 Mountains’ and ‘Original Forms from the East’ series which culminated from his traveling to the places he painted this final series relied more on the imagination. The ‘10 Traditional Symbols of Longevity’ series reflects the age-old ideals of Eastern civilization’s utopia. In that respect the subject of this series is quite abstract compared to mountains or ancient relics. Nevertheless the ‘10 Traditional Symbols of Longevity’ series reflects the yearnings of civilization. These longings have had a great influence on the spiritual and cultural life of Eastern civilization. They are common to people of all social status and because of their powerful symbolism are beloved by everyone. The ‘10 Traditional Symbols of Longevity’ series deals with concrete and tangible things such as nature and living creatures but paradoxically become abstract as they are combined with the world of the imagination. The 10 Traditional Symbols of Longevity are actually traditional symbols but as they reach the canvas of the artist a new uniqueness is brought to the theme. The artist does not simply derive artistic themes from ancient relics but goes on to set the values reflected in these themes in a modern day context. This is an ideal way of passing on traditions. Oh Seung Woo’s art can be seen as a journey in pursuit of these values.   ▣ Related Events and Schedule   The opening ceremony of the exhibition will be held in the lobby of the Seoul Museum of Art on April 22 (Thursday) at 5 PM. During the entire exhibition period there a lecture will be held every day at 1PM to explain the artist’s work. Also open to the public is the ‘Museum Date with Oh Seung Woo’ which will feature an overview of the museum ‘Curator Gallery Talk’ and much more on April 28 (Wednesday) May 12 (Wednesday) May 19 (Wednesday) and May 26(Wednesday). A Free audio guide ‘Journey with the Artist’ will also be available to visitors. The audio guide will include commentaries on individual art works artist’s notes and memoirs. The exhibition will be a special opportunity to view Oh Seung Woo’s full oeuvre and to commemorate his donation of such.

Seoul Museum of Art has collected about 300 works through total 3rd collecting activities in last year.  Among them 253 works were purchased and 47 works  were donated. Seoul Museum of Art have collected works in several genres such as 49  Korean paintings 131 western paintings 15 printmaking 43 sculptures 15 handicrafts 2 calligraphies 37 photos 7 media arts and 1 installation and as the result total collections of Seoul Museum of Art become 2807works.   Looking at the trend of collection in 2009 firstly the works of the late major artists such as Yoo Young-kuk Kim Whanki Pyo Seung-Hyeon Choi Wook-kyung etc. who are the representative artists of Korean modern art have been collected and Min Gyeong-Gap who is one of representative Korean colored painters donated his 36 works including &lt;Wealth(剖)&gt; which was specially selected at National Art Exhibition. Thus the collections of Korean paintings have been supplemented qualitatively. Also we had planed the qualitative improvement for the composition of collections by supplementing the existing collections by the time and the genre through the works of artist Han Mook Chung Tak-young Shim Jung-soo Choi Man-lin Kim Byung-jong Hong Seung-hye Hwang Yong-yop Cha Ou-hi Kwon Sun-Hyeong and etc.  Meanwhile we have extended the function of collections as ‘public art’ close to citizen by installing outdoor sculptures of artist Lee Sang-Gil Kim Bang-Heui Oh Sang-Il Noh Jun Lee Ki-Chil and etc. dividing 10 sculptures at outdoor place of Park of Seoul and 2 sculptures at outdoor place of Nanji Art Studio. In case of a sculpture also lots of works beyond the traditional materials and methods such as Ji Yong-ho’s works making use of scrap tires Yang Young-Hoi’s works making use of scrap iron and etc. had been collected. For photos the aspect of photo collections which placed weight on documentary photos in the past has become more abundant because various works showing the extended trends of modern photos had been largely collected.   A collection is the one of the most important factors showing the character and the mission of a museum as the foundation to be existed it. The collection of artistic works is the tool to establish the identity of all museums and also the trend of collection becomes the standard to estimate the direction that a museum will go forward in the future. Seoul Museum of Art will continuously play the role as the driving force of Korean art by showing the history of Korean modern art and collecting substantial works that it is possible to introduce the dynamicity of modern arts as the modern museum representing Seoul. Also we will make constantly an effort to secure collections which are the cultural heritage of citizen preserve them carefully and share them with citizen much variously than before.","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192839_9c1c11b6c1de4a768afda66caa5f955c_2d73c31257154cf2b3d2c801e2e921b1"

Accordingly traditional sculpture has long tended to take the form of upright monuments. In the today’s art world however the tendency of genre deconstruction has become widespread leading to the boundary between the genres of sculpture and painting - that is three-dimensional and two-dimensional art forms - to become blurred. Artists of our time continue to conduct experiments trying hard to free their work from the elements that have traditionally been regarded as the intrinsic attributes of sculpture such as mass gravity and monumentality. The works exhibited under the title Against the Sculptural raise questions about the attributes of sculpture and deconstruct the system that makes something a sculpture. They also give a brief overview of the phenomenon of installation art the art of creating sculptural works in a fluid and indefinite form.             Today’s sculptors seek to avoid the upright monumental features and explore variable forms and concepts. As sculpture was first defined from the perspective of creating monuments it seems only natural that artists today are attempting to deconstruct ‘the monument’. As such artists now employ various methods such as hanging piling laying on the ground and fragmentation which oppose the traditional desire for upright standing sculpture. They have also expanded the scope of the materials they use including those that previously were regarded as unsuitable as proper sculptural materials and in so doing have brought about changes to the heaviness solidity balance and uprightness of traditional sculpture via a variety of methods such as softening liquefaction compression expansion and condensation. It is through such efforts that modern sculptures have shifted from being a clearly defined mass to a changeable fluidic form. The works in this exhibition are expected to help grasp an aspect of the dramatic changes that have occurred in modern sculptural art such as Process Art in which an artwork exists not as an end product but a process and Earth Art that uses a natural landscape as its material and canvas.   The works include sculptures that appear very fragile as if composes of only skin. Yet they reveal or resist gravity which is an uncontrollable power defining form. These sculptures reveal a harmony between an objet d'art and the objects that haven’t been treated as sculptural materials such as air wind and sound. Thus here the emphasis has been placed on the deconstruction of traditional sculpting.    The artists behind the sculptures created them according to the properties of the materials used and the plastic theory of structures in order to construct narratives about the motives means and messages behind their deconstruction of traditional sculpting. The exhibition will be a great guide for the general art lover into a new world sculptures. One distinguished from the works of earlier generations via their escape from and the construction of the sculptures of their contemporary artists as well as the traditional sculptural forms and matters and the expression of private sensibility.  ○ Layout of the Exhibition Part 1.  Magnetic Field of Power - Anxiety  This exhibition features sculptures standing on a balance point of power via gravity and tension and works made to reveal or crack the balance and gravity via the methods of hanging leaning and moving that have traditionally supported the art of sculpture. - Artists:   Part 2. Physical Imagination and Objects ? Worthlessness  Featured here are sculptures displaying a flattened hollowed softened or lightened body that have been made using seemingly worthless objects   Part 3. Vaporized Sculptures ? Liquidity  The sculptures shown here are in an evaporated immaterial state with almost no mass and volume to display a matter-focused imagination and the temporariness and changeability of forms. This was achieved by using such elements as air light and water. The works exhibit an important aspect of contemporary sculpting where everything evaporates except for atmosphere emotion or concept.

The exhibition is aimed to introduce viewers to multiple viewpoints to the sculpture of the human body via a collection of 27 works sculpted by 21 master artists. The works are carefully selected from a larger collection of sculptures owned by the museum to focus on the beauty of the human body.  Some insist that modern sculptural works of the human body are rather boring but many art lovers are still easily attracted to the sculptures for the texture and movement of a material mass chosen for the works as well as the sensibility of the artists who carved them. As a social product and an expression of human sensibility a work of art guides viewers to an understanding of what social influence has changed it just through a close look. The Seoul Museum of Art has a large collection of sculpture that has existed for a long period reflecting history and it selected sculptural works of the human body featuring materials and techniques that can appeal to teenage viewers. The exhibition is expected to provide young viewers an opportunity to touch and feel the great three-dimensional works they have seen in art textbooks and have a memorable artistic experience.  ▣ Layout of the Exhibition and Participating Artists SectionⅠ. Warmth of Life This section exhibits works created by artists who are interested in the establishment of their own aesthetic world and identity via representation of human figures. It is true that modern human figure sculptures made by traditional techniques have been overshadowed by other diverse and exciting media of the postmodern period and tend to fail in attracting attention from both critics and general art lovers. The works collected for this exhibition however are worth rediscovering their value as a matrix for the development of sculpture and for a wealth of expressions contained in them.  Section Ⅱ. Hands That Touch and Feel  “What is real is not the external form but the essence of things. … It is impossible for anyone to express anything essentially real by imitating its exterior surface.” (Constantin Brancusi) The works exhibited in this section are marked by the direct or indirect expression of abstractness which is the language representing 20th century art and interest in the material itself and the expression of the physical energy and characteristics of each material used for the works. These works are a revelation of temperance which is a profound reflection of the artists’ intention rather than their quest for artistic reality in a representational manner.  Section Ⅲ. Eyes Directed towards Tomorrow  The sculptural works in this section are characterized by the effort to transcend traditional forms and materials and use a great variety of experimental techniques forms and hybrid materials. The authors of the sculptures exhibited here tend not to be satisfied with the current tendency and continue to study hard to find their own plastic vocabulary.  This exhibition aims to help viewers have a comprehensive overview of the Korean history of sculpture in a macroscopic viewpoint via a collection of human figure sculptures created as a result of the artists’ aesthetic struggle. It is expected to give a particularly productive opportunity to young art lovers as many of these sculptures are great masterpieces they have seen in art textbooks and they are accompanied by commentaries that arouse viewers’ interest and are easy to understand. The introduction of diverse sculptural materials and techniques as well as informative biographical and critical notes combined by famous works of sculpture are expected to create a sense of intimacy among young viewers towards art and the museum.  The exhibition is also accompanied by special educational programs specially designed to entertain children and teenagers and give them helpful art-related information including “DIY Natural Soap Making” and “How to Make a Museum Tour Report” and lecture programs aimed to nurture artistic creativity and increase general understanding of three-dimensional plastic art.

The works exhibited in the event are divided into several categories according to the scheme set up in 2004 including painting sculpture handicraft and print. The guidelines of each event including the invitation of artists are decided through the meetings of the Exhibition Advisory Committee that the museum has operated since 2004 as part of the effort to secure maximum fairness and objectivity. The main focus of this year’s event will be placed on “handicraft” following last year’s “representation paintings.”  ■ Handicraft Five Sounds ? The Seoul Art Exhibition 2009 is the first exhibition in five years following The Seoul Art Exhibition 2004 that focused its attention on handicraft with an aim to offer museum goers a rare opportunity to experience a comprehensive overview of the changes and development of Korean modern arts and crafts from multiple points of view.

The artists have been devoted to amalgamation between aesthetic value and practical function of craftwork while surmounting the difficulties of maintaining the identity of handicraft as an art genre. They also played a leading role in the fight for the survival of handicraft and the establishment of its aestheticism. A closer look at the 130 handicraft items exhibited for the event will present viewers with a valuable opportunity to have a general overview of the handicraft its glory in the past its development during the modern period and its artistic potential in the future.  ■ In Korea handicraft has been closely related with everyday life in which it explored both functionality to meet the demands of daily life and the aesthetic value formed through the communication with various cultural aspects of the society. The origin of Korea’s modern handicraft can be found in the period of industrialization during which new concepts were formed and further developed under the influence of political and social heteronomy dominating the country. The development of Korean handicraft involved continued struggle to rediscover the value of handicraft as part of cultural heritage art and industry in the specific historical and structural restrictions imposed by significant historical events such as the Japanese colonial rule and the Korean War. This event held to provide a comprehensive overview of the growth process of Korean handicraft will guide visitors to a reflection of Korean handicraft’s identity and prospects.   &gt;&gt; Details and participants by section  ■ Pottery Pottery is the art based on the primeval properties and the play element of earth. A work of pottery featuring adequate form and weight that is created by heat of optimum temperature displays warmth and composure resulting from the philosophy matured through earth fire and water.

"000116","Age of Monsters - Dissonant Visions","","Seoul Museum of Art Exhibition Room 1 (1st floor at main building)","2009-06-24","2009-08-30","","","","","","Overall contemporary Art"," 60 pieces ","","","This exhibition aims to introduce general art lovers to various interpretations of modern art focused on monsters the fantastic creatures made by artists’ wild imagination.   Artists have continued to exploit their wild imagination since very long ago to create monsters that can stimulate the imagination of their viewers. Then and now they preferred using monster metaphors to represent in their work the discord from the conflict between the current world and the value of individual people refusal or violation of the existing order and systems and the disharmony between the one’s original self and the self imposed by society. It is generally agreed that one of the most significant hidden codes to help read the diverse trends of today’s art world that keeps on changing at an alarming speed is “dissonance” which appears as a monster of our time. That is why the works by 21 artists collected for this exhibition under the title Dissonant Visions can be united by a single common denominator. The word “monster” came from two Lain words “monstrare” (literally meaning “to show”) and ‘monere’ (literally “to warn”). The origin of the word reveals that monster had referred at least before the 19th century to a human being who should be a warning for all through revelation of his vice madness unreason violation or other spiritual or moral deviation rather than something visually ugly or fearful. A monster was not something created naturally but by modern knowledge based on human culture and art which is also a creature represented as the other in the historical context of the time. Monstrousness has gradually been expressed by the image of mankind who lost control over the world as it becomes more and more difficult for modern people to know what is good and what is bad and hence what should be expressed as a monster. Today we face increasing instability of human existence disastrous reality of the modern society and uncertainty about the future while traditional rational order and value continue to suffer a state of confusion in this “hybrid” world. The exhibition is expected to offer an opportunity to reflect upon the inhumane brutality which exists in the depth of modern people through the shapes of monsters that appear before us in a greater variety in modern painting.   Contents and Participants by Section   This exhibition aims to help viewers escape from the traditional preconception of a monster or what is monstrous and expand the horizon of their imagination to make new diverse interpretations of the monster and the modern world. The exhibition is participated in by 21 artists and their works featuring a great diversity in terms of materials forms and contents including painting photography sculpture installation and video that are divided into three sections according to theme.  Section 1. The Revelation of Dystopia  The works collected in this section are characterized by the rhetoric of monstrousness with which the artists look at the depression of their time as a revelational response to the disastrous reality of modern society. The themes of the works include despair and horror about the absurdity and illness of the world discomfort and pessimism about civilized society and the inhuman brutality hidden inside it and uncertainty of the future society vulnerable to the uncontrollable change in science and technology.   Section 2. Forbidden Land  The works in this section are focused on the meaning of monsters as a being that refuses to accept the traditional values and prejudices of existing human society and violates its rules. The creatures that violate taboos in these works feature aspects of a monster as if to represent Foucault’s definition of the monster as a union between impossibility and taboo. The monster depicted here is in short a creature standing on or crossing the boundary between two irreconcilable worlds. The modern world is the world of hybrids ? marked by the breach of the rules of nature mixture between species and confusion of boundaries and characteristics ? and disturbs the existing order and values based on reason by revealing its monstrous aspects represented by hybrids.  Section 3. The Monster Inside Me  The works in this section deal with the dark side of human nature and madness. Art is an aesthetic expression of a time an artist’s statement on his or her perception of social reality and a result of his or her exploration of the inner essence of mankind. What is depicted in these works may be the horror about being in the depth of human mind the artist’s alter ego or a psychological self-portrait of all of us. A closer look at these works may help viewers find the monster lurking inside them.

Fri: 10 am to 8 pm / Saturday Sunday and holidays 10 am to 6 pm","","Entire section of modern art ","40pieces","","","“Cheerful and serious works of the imagination unfold to disassemble and reassemble time and space in a huge cinema.”  “A fantastic moment of immersion in which the black box of a cinema turns into the white cube of an art gallery.” “The very point where the cinematographic illusion encounters a desire for pure art.”   The Cinematic Montage Today we live in a so called ‘era of composite images.” Cartoons movies and TV dramas show a world that has been dismantled and then reassembled representing it via the images composed by the superimposition or juxtaposition of disassembled pieces. This exhibition focuses on the development of the montage as part of the contemporary cultural background and introduces a collection of montages made in various forms of modern art from socio-political criticism to surrealistic fantasy monologue narration to visual rhythm.  Since the 20th century modern art has developed a variety of forms and meanings in combination with the characteristic features of cinema. The term “cinematic” has formed an important discourse on contemporary art and is profusely used in various art genres including painting photography installation and video. The technique of composing a work by mixing various elements of performance sculpture cinema and still pictures is now widely regarded as one of the most experimental and spectacular forms seen in the work of many contemporary artists. These works provide viewers with an environment in which they can immerse themselves in the exhibition guiding them into a realm of imagination through a transcendence of time and space. This is the moment in which the mental activities taking place within the black box of a cinema become more active in the white cube of an art gallery.   What is the “montage technique”? ? Aestheticism of fragments The “montage technique” which played a crucial role in the development of cinema in the 19th century has now become a very important factor for building composite images of time and space. In this age of composition the meaning and scope of montage has continued to expand to the extent that some conclude that “all viewpoints of the world form a single montage” and thus the montage is now treated as being more important than ever before. What is then the original meaning of the montage how has it developed and what are its characteristics? Montage is a French word meaning “putting together” and refers to a method of film editing that combines fragmentary film shots selected from separate films to create visual rhythms and psychological sensations by building a new reality in cinematic time and space. It may be compared with the technique of facial composite imaging in that separate memories are put together to “create” a single object. It involves not only technical but also mental and psychological fabrication and the montage is completed in the eye of each viewer. The fabrication takes place through various methods of arranging fragments such as juxtaposition segmentation and combination and generates meaning on a new level via the conflict of two opposing pieces.  This exhibition shows the point at which cinematic fantasy intersects with the desire for pure art on the basis of such montage techniques. In film the techniques influenced each other in the 20th century through the collage works of Braque and Picasso Mallarme’s poetry and Rodin’s sculpture while in photography they established an independent genre. The flood of digital images has recently led to net-based montages made via the combination of various sources collected from the web helping further expand the scope of montages. Ultimately this event aims at a critical understanding of today’s social political and cultural discourses raised by the amalgamation of fragments such as painting sculpture installation sound video and computer games that reflect the changed environment of art due to digitalization. Indeed today’s montages go beyond a simple combination of individual cuts as shown by the existing films and photography. In addition the exhibition is expected to provoke a cheerful but serious stirring of the imagination by dismantling the world in which we live and then assembling the fragments within the time and space encapsulated in a cinema.      Objectives of the Exhibition ▶ The exhibition offers viewers the opportunity to become completely immersed in the artists’ cheerful but serious imaginations that disassemble and reassemble the world in cinematic time and space within the white cube of an art gallery via the montage techniques of segmentation juxtaposition assemblage and combination.  ▶ The exhibition helps viewers experience a new cinematic form of modern art generated by amalgamating various elements of performance sculpture theater film and still pictures that result in some of the most experimental and spectacular expressions of contemporary artists. ▶ The exhibition shows a special selection of montage films and guides viewers to the point where cinematic fantasy intersects with the desire for pure art via the montage techniques.

This year Hankook Ilbo jointly presents with Seoul Museum of Art and SBS a collection of paintings by Pierre-Auguste Renoir (1841-1919) a forerunner of Impressionist art and one of the world’s most beloved artists whose paintings focus on sensuality and joy. The event takes place from May 28 to September 13 2009.   Renoir is often cited as the only figure of all the masters who lived through art’s turbulent era of the late 19th century but took up no tragic themes for his art. He believed that a painting should be “joyful cheerful and beautiful” and left over 5000 oil paintings depicting the joy and delight of life via a fusion of colors and light.  Held as Korea’s first retrospective exhibition on the works of Renoir the event guides art lovers to the true meaning of happiness in daily life in which the exuberance of light and colors expel darkness of our turbulent world. Visitors to the exhibition will be offered a rare opportunity to have a delightful journey into happiness captured by a master who believed that “a painting should be a gift of joy that cleanses the soul of mankind.”  ▶▷ An Impressionist Master Who Left the World’s Most Beautiful Paintings  “A painting should be something that pleases the viewer’s eyes.”  Paintings by Renoir are not just simple depictions or representations of a scene capturing transient effects of light. His paintings are first of all something that entertains viewers and their eyes. His paintings are joy and happiness of life in the expression of contemporary life or classical beauty of sensuality as “life is an eternal holiday.” Happiness that one encounters through the world’s most beautiful paintings -- that is the promise of the Renoir’s paintings.  “Renoir’s First Retrospective Exhibition in Korea” This event is Korea’s third major exhibition focused on the art of Impressionist masters following that of Monet (420000) in 2007 and van Gogh (810000) in 2008 and the first exhibition devoted to the art of Renoir.

Organized as part of the celebration for National Family Month and the Hi Seoul Festival the exhibition will be held at several different venues including those in the museum’s front yard garden and entrance road. It was launched in 2004 as a special event and has since been held annually under different themes providing general museum goers with an opportunity for exciting cultural experiences and refreshments. This year’s event held under the title “Attack the Museum!” presents collections designed for pleasant artistic communication with citizens visiting the museum to spend a more pleasant springtime.  ★”Attack the Museum! ? Museum Visit in Spring 2009” Popular cartoon images seized all the open space outside the art museum in an event called “Attack the Gas Station!” Art lovers are invited to the site where the cheerful assault took place.  Conceived from the imagination of the enthusiasts in fine art animation wooden figure models and cartoon characters this exhibition is open to all creating an exciting festival in which art museum space is integrated with non-mainstream culture.  ▣ Wild imagination and cartoon images ? A sudden assault of the non-mainstream culture  “Art museum and a sudden assault”: what on earth does this ill-matched combination try to show? With a title conceived from a successful Korean film Attack the Gas Station! this exhibition Attack the Museum! is based on a concept that a collection of delightful works of art made from wild imagination occupy all the corners of the museum. What is wild imagination then? It is the imagination of enthusiasts who have an obsession with their own world or something they are fond of. They tend to feel pressed into roles as “economic animals” in a society of severe competition but easily escape into a fantasy developed in their own world. They spend a lot of time even more time than that required for their livelihood to find stories and characters in video games and cartoons which they use as their own materials to recreate new icons via modification and adaptation. Cultural phenomena such as this exert a powerful influence upon young artists through exchange with so called “highbrow culture.” The modified use of styles and stories taken from other art genres are now very commonly found forming an axis of contemporary art.  ▣ Art museum and attack ? Reserved occupation The goal of Attack the Museum! is to attack the stronghold of highbrow art based on the non-mainstream concept although in the reserved manner of images commonly seen in cartoons. Therefore visitors to the museum will be met by works which look much like toys and products of cartoonist imagination. Much of the space outside the museum is occupied by tanks unidentifiable monsters animals artist’s figures and heroic characters lurking here and there as if waiting for a chance to break into the interior of the museum. These creatures are in fact non-mainstream art works estranged from the central stage of art rather than fearful attackers armed with lethal weapons. They encircled the art museum a symbol of elite art world and are poised to start an attack in an attractive rather than detestable manner.   A monster perched on the roof of the museum fa?ade appears comical and far from being scary. A closer look at a tank crouching near the museum either to guard or attack it reveals that it is in fact a “Banana-flavored Milk Tank” presenting the artist’s concept that the banana-flavored milk is distributed to meet the criteria of the mainstream West. The “Men in Suits” standing in line around the museum’s main entrance like guards display the appearance of ordinary office workers although there is something weird around them. A group of animals found their place at the museum’s garden packed with high-priced works of art as if having “Tea Time” while the “Cloud Man” with legs grown from clouds tries a safe landing on the museum. The word “attack” used here is not an offensive action taken to hurt others but a humorous and comic one in which creatures that can’t be related with a museum in any way suddenly develop into art works and storm the museum. Viewers generally feel that they have seen and are even familiar with these works of cartoon images gathered in the museum but at the same time viewers find that there is some strangeness about them as they seem to appear as commercial products or animation characters.  ▣ What is an attack? ? From occupation to joint ownership  The event Attack the Museum! aims at delivering joy and delight to art lovers through art helping them overcome any despair they might suffer from the current economic recession. The “attack” in this exhibition refers to an action through which such creatures as cartoons artist’s figures toys and others born from some enthusiasts’ imagination seize a museum that deals only with solid and sacred “high art.” Similarly the word also closely related with occupation or seizure makes us redefine the meaning of museum space. With the word the concept of a museum as a sacred space owning or owned by art works develops into that referring to a space open to and shared by non-mainstream culture formed via the “maniac imagination” in art. Such a development dims the boundary between mainstream and non-mainstream low culture and high culture and winner and loser. The exciting attack eventually causes viewers to question whether their hero is in fact an intruder or the creatures they regard as intruding monsters are in fact their guardian deities. This transforms the museum as a space for elites into an open space where all kinds of wild imaginations gather and prosper together. As a result the event in which it is not clear who attacks whom and no clear boundary exists between cheerfulness and cheerlessness becomes an exciting festival in which people of all backgrounds are mixed with each other.  ▣ Information on the main artists participating in the event Open to exhibit works unreserved in traveling across popular culture cartoonist imagination and art this exhibition is participated in by artists who freely cross the borders between several different artistic and industrial genres including design advertisement and animation. The artists include: Young Kim a Korean American artist who has been active in the U.S. via various art directing and installation art projects with works based on the portraits and characters of the artist himself; Sticky Monster Lab a group of artists engaged in multiple art genres such as digital animation figure and illustration with characters known as Monsters; and Hwang Eun-jeong who is based in the U.S. and Germany and gaining reputation with works involving animation of various characters Future Creatures created by the artist.

The museum’s efforts in this regard have so far helped it to amass a vast collection of 2507 art pieces. While this is a remarkable achievement the museum continues to use its resources to completing the collections of various artists or periods in Korean art history.  ○ It was as part of its acquisition project that the museum purchased the works by Gwon Ok-yeon Yi Jun Yi Eung-no Jeon Roe-jin Ha Jong-hyeon Choe Jong-tae O Seung-u Kim Bong-tae Yi Gyu-seon Park Gwang-jin Kim Gu-rim Yeo Un Park Sang-suk and others. The works of these artists had already been collected by the museum but the collection was not sufficient to show the development of the artists by style or period. This meant that the museum needed to continue to purchase their works to supplement the existing collections and thus better explain the periods of change. As these artists occupy center stage in the history of Korean modern art and exerted a strong influence upon it broader collections of their work will give a clearer picture of the development of Korean art. As for Autumn (秋 1968) by Yi Jun which was one of the museum’s most recent purchases for instance experts regard it to be a crucial work in explaining his transition to geometric abstraction.      ○ The most important means of completing the museum’s collections has been through the purchase of the works it requires; however the other equally important source to perfecting its collections is via donations. The donation of the works of some of Korea’s master artists such as Park No-su Gwon Yeong-u and Choe Deok-hyu played in fact a crucial role in enhancing the quality and quantity of the museum’s collections of these artists. In 2008 other important donations were made to the museum.  ○ The 2008 donations consisted of 45 photographs by Yuk Myeong-sim collected under The Artist Series and 35 paintings by Oh Seung-u which included the paintings of the Ten Creatures of Longevity landscapes depicting some scenic sites in Korea and renowned overseas Buddhist temples. The photographs of The Artist Series are portraits of some of Korea’s most admired artists poets and Gugak musicians including Kim Gi-chang Yi Jong-u O Ji-ho Seo Jeong-ju Park Mok-wol Hwang Sun-won and Hwang Byeong-gi. The photographs are currently on exhibition in the museum’s Namseoul Gallery. The museum also made great efforts to achieve a balance between art genres by collecting the textiles of Yi Sin-ja the ceramics of Yi Heon-guk and the calligraphy of Yi Su-deok.    ○ Some of the works were collected via online subscriptions including paintings by Choe Yeong-geol Kim In-tae Hwang Yong-jin Seo Jeong-tae Son Su-gwang Gwon Gi-beom Sin Geum-nye Jeong Jin-yong Hong Jae-yeon Gang Jin-sik Ha Gwan-sik Hwang Hye-seon Jo Mun-ja and Yi Jeong-ji while others including the works by Cha U-hi Go San-geum Jeong So-yeon Park Seok-hwan and Yun Ae-yeong were collected via the museum’s special art shows. The museum has also collected sculptural works for open-air exhibitions: Hand of Promise II by Gang Hi-deok on display in the sculptural park of Seoul Forest and Samgeunmok 2 by Yi Gil-rae resides in the open-air sculpture park of Nanji Studio.  ○ A lack of exhibition space led the museum to divide the collection into several sections according to genre and to display them in turn. The first exhibition under the new system will be entitled New Acquisitions 2008 and the museum expects it to be an effective report of their acquisition activities up to now for art lovers visiting the museum.

While the traditional synesthetic paintings were interested in didactic presentation of the evanescence and futility of senses depending on the objects symbolizing the senses today’s paintings reveal that synesthesia is used as a tool to give inspiration and imagination to the making and viewing of the works. These works guide viewers to an inquiry into how the tendency of synesthesia which continues to be discussed in literature and art as a form of special ability or universal perception and as a socio-political code appears or is materialized in today’s art and how it becomes the source of the artists’ imagination.   The exhibition consists of two sections. The works collected under the first section “I. Sensory Illusions” show that viewers can experience transition and association of other senses in a painting which is traditionally regarded as an art form requiring only the viewer’s vision. The paintings of the second section “I. Multiple Sense: Crossing and Blending” lead viewers to a new aesthetic experience by stimulating the senses of hearing touch smell and taste in a multiple manner and an interaction between the artworks and viewers.  The exhibition is expected to offer viewers an opportunity to get over the traditional prejudice that a work of art is there only to be seen and instead to feel and experience it in a new context. In addition modern art while it tends to be regarded as having become too difficult and complex to access due to the diversified use of media can become more communicative due to the exhibition’s function of exciting multiple senses and multi-faceted sensibility. The event will also lead viewers to an aspect of the discourse or phenomenon of today’s art where there is no single answer due to the synesthesia that defy the causal relationship of one-to-one correspondence.   ■ Participating Artists   “I.

As high-performance digital cameras rapidly spread recently the camera is no longer a luxurious item for the general public. By using this camera we capture all objects in our daily lives. The photographic images we have taken are shared by all through online mediums. As we grow gradually more interested in photography photography is given with another meaning beyond the function of simple recording through the processes of modifying and editing images.   Along with this social phenomenon in a recent few years mid-career blue-chip photographers in their 40s and 50s distinguish themselves through their international activities. Photographic theoreticians who studied abroad debate issues of photographic art. The major art museums at home and abroad often hold enormous scale photographic exhibitions to shed light on the true nature of photographic art and primary galleries and collectors purchase photographic works at high prices. This exhibition aims to raise productive discourses on contemporary art by embracing reading feeling and communicating with photographs from new perspectives departing from the previous point of view.  If briefly reviewing the history of Korean photography in modern Korean photography an idea was to pursue its independent existence and value to escape from painting. The theories of modern photographic aesthetics were able to keep photography from external impeachment but they sometimes hampered the expansion of a photographic sphere and improvement of liberal expression. In the 1960s contemporary photography began refusing all restrictions embracing new perception and senses that are unimaginable from established perspectives and techniques. The standard to interpret reality and the senses to feel objects have changed. At that time journalist-turned-photographers and amateur photographers entered in artistic work and continued their artistic photographs up to the 70s and 80s. Directly or indirectly influenced by the conceptions of contemporary photography that addressed a wide variety of photographic genres such as documentary photos portrait photos commercial photos and celebrity photos they grew and discussed the contact point of photography and art.  Since the mid-1990s young contemporary artists in the fields of painting and sculpture were captivated by photography's mechanism and documentary quality and thus actively exploited it for their work. Their works were displayed at major museums and large-scale galleries. It is recorded as a significant turning point in the history of contemporary Korean photography. The tendencies photography accepted other genres and other genres embraced photography appeared from the late 1990s up to today. Photographs produced through diverse mediums and techniques opened up a new horizon in contemporary photographic art. Since then contemporary Korean photography was not regarded as something separate from contemporary art but is seen as an extension of contemporary art forming the forum for productive discourse.  In this show outstanding artworks by eminent photographers are diversely recomposed and displayed. This exhibition is meaningful in that it aims to enhance the viewers' understanding of contemporary photography by providing them with the opportunity to have a new perception of it and to shift their conception.","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192837_b28541732a364e958cec393016f384c2_db521d04d8cf467b8eeae99aa9ea9779"
"000108","Seoul Art Exhibition 2008","the currents of Korea's modern figurative painting","1F Main Building Seoul Museum of Art","2008-12-20","2009-02-22","","","","","","","","","","■  The Seoul Museum of Art (SeMA) hosts the 23th &lt;Seoul Art Exhibition 2008-the currents of Korea's modern figurative painting-&gt; from December 20 2008 to February 22 2009. As an annual event since 1985 the exhibition has progressed into specifying such concrete genres as paintings sculptures ceramics and prints on display. This year's show focuses on figurative painting following the last year's print. ■ To bring the currents of modern figurative painting in Korea to light the exhibition displays the works of 68 actively working domestic painters of the ages of 50s and ups. Distant from realistic paintings common in young generations their paintings will provide an opportunity to reveal typical characteristics deeply rooted in traditional styles of Korea's contemporary figurative paintings. ■ Often illustrating opposite concepts of abstract art figurative painting can make it possible to check various inner aspects of the figurative frameworks. This year's exhibition tries to go beyond the conceptual issues of the genre and inspect diverse trends focusing on actual circumstances by providing three sessions on the show: &lt;Representation and Existence&gt; &lt;Transformation and Formality&gt; and &lt;Everyday lives and Illusions&gt;. &lt;Representation and Existence&gt; puts more emphasis on attitudes faithful to objects and being on spot. While some attempt to lift up moulding values of representation others try to achieve unity with nature in which the ways to personalism often lie behind through strongly expressed elements. &lt;Transformation and Formality&gt; stands out that the expression of subjectivity overwhelms nature or objects somehow or other. Because these paintings reflect the painters' emotional reactions to nature or objects rather than factual descriptions they tend to overexaggerate modify or omit dramatically which could be called an expressive attitude or phase. The phase transcending this to pursuing a painter' unique plastic art could obviously reach conventionalization. Exposing Hyperrealism which first appeared as intensive reactions to objects and has spread out widely among young generations since then &lt;Everyday Lives and Illusions&gt; uncovers evolved forms of common lives into fantasy while displaying incisive sensuous responses to everyday lives. ■ With regards to the distribution pattern of the painters figurative painters outnumber others which is usual in other countries as well. Unfortunately since the advent of abstract art in 1960s figurative painting has not established its domains well enough. Although it includes not only the majority of paintings but also various types of concepts the lack of positive evaluation of it might result from the lack of efforts to discover and develop multifaceted factors. Holding 100th anniversary of western painting's introduction into Korea inspecting current aspects of figurative painting and the basis of western paintings will surely be a stepping-stone of strengthening unique identity of Korean art.

Ancient Future a title adopted from the title of the essay by Helena Norberg Hodge linguist and crusader is a suggestion to look upon the present and future of contemporary arts based upon its long tradition pursuing the progress of mankind.  ■Ancient Future is to prospect philosophical and aesthetic reflections on environment nature and human with questions for value of the life: nature manipulated by the human and boundaries between nature and art life and death the real and the false the cyclic and the acyclic in social and psychological manners beyond a simple representation of ecological nature. The keywords like circulation-community-organic contact-desire-hybrid utopia Eros and Thanatos uncomfortable scenes throw questions about our existence creatures in the environment.   ■ This exhibition provides opportunities to recognize extended meanings of environment a space which is essential as a filed of life to view the cultural dimension: relations between animals and plants the geographical history of places and changing socio-ecological relations. In the process of humans achieving material wellbeing based on a human-oriented perspective they have been destroying ecology which is the basis of life. The effort of humans to realize utopia by conquering nature was followed by the ruined ecology contamination and exhaustion of resources while justifying their domination over nature due to their anxiety for progression and the overwhelming nature with artificially modified or transplanted man-created environment changed the life of humans and all the other creatures. The modified nature has occurred not only physical change but the change of mentality. A human desire to control the life by gaining the blueprint of life is obviously a point to blur the division between the living and the nonliving thing. A readily transplanted man-made nature to copy mix and match the basic nature is eventually a place which appears as if a theater stage under construction where actors are trying to make up a series of stories but the ending is depending on the audience. Thus the audience gets to experience environment as a creature and nature artificially modified to be replaced with mutants by preferences by being invited to the exhibition room divided on the 1st and 2nd floor to stage the time based narratives. It is somewhat to experience the time and history which flows from utopia to dystopia by metaphors just as a play as well as a gesture to emphasize on reality mixed with life and death nature and art and the real and the false. ■ Throughout various perspectives to examine the relation between nature and human beings Ancient Future views the interdependent relationship among arts environment nature and humans. Accordingly it is expected to look upon the lost value in suggestions though aesthetically and socially multilateral gazes.

Arranged by Didier Ottinger chief curator of the Centre Georges Pompidou this exhibition includes 79 master pieces of collections of the Centre Georges Pompidou in several different genres such as paintings installations and visual arts which have never been exhibited in Korea. The exhibition is classified into 10 small themes including 'Golden Age' 'Joy' 'Messenger' 'Harmony' Darkness.' 'Recovered Arcadia' and 'Lunch on the Grass.' It gives specific image of heaven in the western culture illuminated by modern artists. The word 'Arcadia' refers to an actual region in the middle of Greece but was depicted as a blessed affluent land by the Latin culture as well as Virgil a poet in ancient Rome. It implies an imaginary world a heaven of fantasy full of shepherds enjoying music thus portraying an idealized fictional world of heaven. Arcadia meaning the ideal that human beings are dreaming of was often described as the Golden age or Paradise and after the 16th century western people called it 'Utopia' which can be compared with 'Moo-Leung-Do-Won(武陵挑源)' in the Asian tradition. Especially the meaning was driven by &lt;&lt;The Arcadian Shepherds (Les Bergers d’Arcadie)&gt;&gt; by Nicolas Poussin known as the founder of the France classical painting. The subtitle 'Even in Arcadia I exist' meaning 'even in heaven death exists' represents the 'heaven' as a place where the boundary between life and death is vague. Therefore it can be seen that the heaven which used to be the symbol of abundance in the Golden age was changed to an extensive root for examining conscience of human beings. This exhibition not only gives a chance to appreciate the best 39 modern artists ranging from the 20th century artists including Picasso Matisse Chagall Miro to the contemporary artists including Yves Klein Gary Hill but also to take a look into the changes of spiritual flow revealed in the Western culture after the 20th century.","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192838_92fdeb023f884afda52a0f622ac345e0_1ab3538e3de441729f7d8b4cd5f7504b"
"000105","Reading the boundary between fiction and nonfiction","","Nam Seoul Annex Building of Seoul Museum of Art","2008-10-15","2008-11-30","","","","","","","","","","As we welcome the autumn best season for reading books we present the 'Reading Fine Arts' as a way of appreciating the arts.  ‘Reading Fine Arts’ introduces the readers of how the artists’ literary concepts are conveyed to the galleryites creating a bond between them. It also shows the method of ‘art reading’ that starts with the understanding of the conceptualized art and how other artists’ works express their unique visions.     This exhibition presents artworks that reveal the artists' sensibility and tries to disturb the boundary line between reality and unreality fiction and nonfiction the concept and the image. It is possible to record reality intentionally based on the fact that photograph and visual media are not just tools that record images. They now can control and create entirely new situations. This phenomenon is not simply drawn from the characteristics of the media but it is also from the attempts of the artists to pull up the hidden stories formed under the multi-dimensional culture and social structures in 21st century expressing it on their works with their sensibility.  The main issue in this exhibition is the interchangeable relationship between 'real' and 'surreal'. It includes the artists who focus on the line between fiction and non-fiction and artworks shown the vagueness between them. Recently it has become possible that a documentary with photographs and images can be connected with a fiction recreating a new meaning above personal social and historical issues and can be analyzed in various directions. This attempt is introduced as the diversity of reality through the cooperation between the use of media and the genre. For instance the meaning of 'installation' as an extended area of a sculpture is not just to present an objet by such a method but as a result it is the reflection of reality showing through the relationship between the representation territory and its suggestive situation. Thus it makes possible to surpass the state of reality or irregularities through the presented mise-en-scene in documentary or its images. It is intended in this exhibition to look into this process of arts with the views in 'fiction and non-fiction.' Suggesting the witty examples to watch and analyze an object this exhibition is to offer a chance to understand the meaning of fiction in fine arts and to step back and forth across the line between fiction and non-fiction in an interesting way. Recently the discussions about the lines between media and between genres have been on the rise. Reality and fiction two and three dimensions and 'reality and simularc' have been dealt in different directions and this attempt has shown and reformed the arts in cooperation with a variety of genres. In this moment this exhibition is set up for a chance to think about these issues in various ways through the artists' own styles shown on their artworks.","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192838_6ddd9cec107043eba812501953e7f821_9aca6a87b18540209eca28893f85d757"

While most media art exhibitions are held once the Seoul International Media Art Biennale starting from 2000 and opening the 5th this year has become one of the remarkable Media Art Biennales in and outside the country serving as a stage for keeping the alive history of media art. Particularly this 5th Biennale is based on the theme 'Turn and Widen' paying attention to the aspect that the advent of media art and its fashion have derived new media into the field of art and it has turned into a new form and it caused the area of art experience to be changed and extended. Thus this Biennale is aimed to find answers through a variety of exhibits to those fundamental essential questions; What is media art? What is different from the conventional art? What changes have been made by that in the field of art? and what influences could come from now? Based on this direction and critical mind above the Biennale classifies the difference between traditional and media art in three points of view and accordingly the exhibition is divided into three parts. The first part the field of light.  This part shows the changes of the state of art. Instead of the stage of using natural light and analyzing it the changes by the advent of lights using the advanced technologies have revealed through artworks created by utilizing lights and by composing the environment through them such as neon-art light kinetic laser art and hologram. It is represented how the images and effects of light presented by electromagnetic waves are expressed in the work and the changes they could draw. The second part the field of communication. The second part focuses on the changes of the communication methods in work of art. As the traditional art was built on the concept of the observation or passive participation by spectators interactive art has emerged in the field of media art that the spectators take an active part to modulate and complete the works. Also the effort to give a variety of multi-sided experiences to the spectators not only with the visual aspect but also auditory and tactile senses has been made. Furthermore virtual reality has been drawn into artworks which show the changes of the perception of reality treated through the artworks. The third part the field of time. By the emergence of artworks using computer and video there has been an extension of the boundary of art which used to be defined as spatial art. In addition the works involving the concept of time have appeared. This part includes video arts and animations in attempts to unfold a story in time artworks containing a motion using a new technology and those under the motive of the changing images with the flow of time.  ■ Exhibiting Artists 80 artists 66 teams from 25 countries (11 teams from Korea 55 teams from abroad)  ■ Free entry -We manage the extension of the “Admission-free Day” for the Seoul International Media Art Biennale.

'Mirror' as a motive makes it to analogize a new world with imitating the original and to look back not only to the exterior but interior. It illuminates the relationship and meaning between the artist his/her self and their works expressing the self. When we reflect an existence and aspect we often call it a 'mirror image.' This is because within the ambivalence of the mirrored image including the reflection as what it is and that of the right side to the left the self-reflection and agony can be driven.According to Jacques Lacan mirror is an object that makes it possible to realize self as a subject. There was a moment that human was called 'Homo Speculum' and the word 'Speculum' meaning 'mirror' in Latin is the origin of 'speculation.' Likewise the existence of mirror reflecting an image itself and its inner side are applied as the important motives that show the artist's inner sight through the subject self-portrait. Self-portrait a genre of portrait is created by a painter with regarding 'self' as an object for representation. Since 'portray' is originated from the Latin word 'protrahere' meaning 'to discover' and 'to draw' self-portrait is beyond drawing a self image; it is to discover another self and to draw the inner self. Thus we can read manifold inner thoughts through the self-portrait such as the artist's mental state self-affection self-display self-identification and self-pity. For artists representing their own views of looking at the world through their works the thought and agony about self can surely be a significant proposition. The inner nature and anguish about identity are the subjects of speculation as the most fundamental proposition for a work of art. Self-portrait one of those to reflect it in the most direct way has been constantly studied with a variety of subjects and methods in the East and West. The acknowledgement of panting self-image began from the Renaissance when the concept of artist and signature on works of art started. The conventional self-portrait was the drawing of the reflected self-image on a mirror and after the development of photography there became a new type of describing it by capturing a moment. Nowadays due to the advent of digital camera self has had a role as an available object by self-capturing methods and it is possible to capture and express a different dimension of self-mage from the one captured by others or by using a tripod. Moreover the methods of synthesizing self with another self-image or disguising it have been reached by the development of different media in order to create a new self and some artists often apply a completely different object into their self-image to symbolize their psychological states. The main feature of this exhibition is to look into the aspects of self-portrait created by Korean artists after the modern age and their inner meanings. It consists of two sections ;&lt;Microcosmos in a face&gt; a collection of works of self-portrait as a mirror image reflecting a face as it is &lt;Inner mirror a mask image&gt; showing the distorted and refracted characteristics of mirror as a 'mask image.' This exhibition has an attempt to look through the works of modern to contemporary artists and to look deeply into what 'self' is for artists what inspiration they could give and from what inspiration they could create their self-portraits and how it is expressed and understood inside their works. Thus it is aimed to offer the opportunity to ask again the meaning of the 'artist him/herself' as a subject matter to consider the diverse changing aspects of expressing identity and to speculate on the images of contemporary artists and ourselves.","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192837_cd950d77b1f741e38272d4950e66539a_f3314102443d47aebbd887248c60614e"

This exhibition is also designed to celebrate the 20th anniversary of opening the Seoul Museum of Art in 2008.  In the special exhibition art generated in the half century of the Korean abstract art is classified into 4 major themes: 'spaces and properties of matter (물성)' 'repetition and structures' 'actions and pastimes' and 'color-field and light'. Selected are 80 unparalleled pieces produced by 44 excellent artists which can be suitably categorized into the above-mentioned 4 themes amongst Korean artists who left their amazing marks on the stage of the Korean abstract art for the past 50 years.   The section of 'spaces and properties of matter' is centered around artists steadily groping for the matters of the plane in paintings and the specificity of materials. They started from hot abstract art and gradually establish their own methods. Under the theme of 'repetition and structures' are artists who show the repetition of single colors and are aware of the plane as the structure which is quite unique in the Korean abstract art.  The section of 'actions and pastimes' consists of Korean artists who are aspired by passionate abstract impressionism and have eyes to post-abstract impressionism. The section of 'color-field and light' is organized with works by color-field abstract artists and the artists who actively embody the concept of light. In this section artists usually quote light as divine revelation and/or focus on the pure incarnation of light.  This exhibition aims at classifying the changing processes of the Korean abstract art for the past 50 years into 4 themes and at trying to communicating between the two generations living this era in the Korean society. In this exhibition you can enjoy the pure awareness of beauty by the generation who consider 'abstract art' is equal to 'modern art' and the young generation pursuing multiple and diverse concepts of 'art.' Sincerity and passion that generated from participating artists all the time will make contribution to the production of far more in-depth and abundance of the contemporary art.","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192837_b6a6efb3d22e482ab50bded48dded0bf_970d2b7098da4345880dafbb63dbbf57"

Our museum collects works of art twice a year. Last year we collected total 235 works of art 88 during the first half and 147 during the second half. We have been collecting works of art since 1985 and with the collection from last year we have total 2237 works of art now.    The works that are going to be displayed at this exhibition are collected thorough our online collection events and special exhibitions. Since before holding a special exhibition works of art for the exhibition are carefully selected after a thorough examination the special exhibitions provided us good opportunities to collect high-quality works of art. Due to the limited space we’ve had to select among the works of art in the collection.    After selecting works of art from the collection we have grouped them by common characteristics. As a result we have come to have seven sections and we have assigned each section a concept that can represent the works of art belonging to the section. We think each concept will help our citizens appreciate and understand the works of art more easily. In fact the exhibition of the collection of the year has been more like an annual report of Museum’s activities of the year and therefore it hasn’t been paying enough attention to providing citizens an opportunity to appreciate works of art. Thus at this exhibition we provide our audience an ‘appreciation map’ consisting of the concepts assigned to the seven sections in order to help them enjoy the exhibition.","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192837_380f493246c2402787119f45165f28ca_998b41b05e7d4e22ac8fd13c4b1e2aa1"

The exhibition &lt;Treasure in My Heart&gt; shows appreciation(hommage) to rich heritage which was such an inspiration to many artists and the origin of their work. This means a lot to the artists as an everlasting theme of their work as well as a never-ending longing. We hope that this gives audience a good opportunity to find and cherish their own treasure through creative art pieces of contemporary artists who instilled the beauty and spirit of our cultural heritage into their works.     South Korea's national treasure Sungnyemun was burned down by an arsonist recently. In relation to this accident people have begun to think over how such cultural properties have been neglected and to realize the importance and value of such heritage.

We all would stretch imagination reading &lt;Gulliver's Travels - to the world of little men and the world of giants&gt; during our childhood. In fact &lt;Gulliver's Travels&gt; of Jonathan Swift was a novel satirizing the dark history of politics of England in the 18'th century. In the little men's world(Lilliput) the politicians are divided into two parties: low heel party and high heel party. They get involved in party strife just because of the height of shoe heel. Further they wage a war against the neighboring country because of their different view on whether to eat an egg from the top or below which represents politicians' simplicity foolishness and ridiculous desire to rule.  ■ The lessons of fairy tales are not limited to children. This fairy tale makes us ponder over the meaning of truth honor justice humility tolerance courage and love through the keen satire of the injustice in the world of adults. That is why the fairy tale(Gulliver's Travels) is presented in association with this exhibition in hope that we can expand the scope of our thinking on objects.  ■ All visitors become Gulliver in this exhibition just as Gulliver travels. Just as Gulliver talks about his experiences in the world of little men and the world of giants artists satirize and represent the reality of this society with their imagination. The artists humorously depict the scenes in our world leading us to the world of imagination.","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192837_fa8424647e4b41f5bf0ebfb80907ea30_2293c934f6254b0298fb518b75dba6e0"

Despite his yearning for the classical beauty of pre-Renaissance nostalgia for Greece's archaic art in particular without limiting himself to its imitation Bourdelle created numerous masterpieces that expressed energy and dynamic force. His art has been placed a great deal of weight in the history of Western sculpture until today.  Emile-Antoine Bourdelle (1861 ~ 1929) was born in Montauban a small town in the Southern France in 1861. Bourdelle developed a novel and exclusive sculpture realm of his own after surveying the sculptures of ancient Greece Rome and even ancient Egypt. Mainly focusing the portrait sculptures of male heroes he left behind a great number of magnificent dynamic rough and powerful masculine sculptures. Bourdelle wished that through the simplification of the shape based on the essential structure of objects sculpture was positioned as independent architecture. By declaring that &quot;Sculpture is to create objects&quot; rather than giving a graphic representation of human beings or nature he suggested the new possibility of sculpture -- sculpture itself is a meaningful form. Ultimately newly establishing the relationship between sculpture and architecture above the form of order and the value of formation Bourdelle could lay the groundwork for his complete monumental sculpture.                   The exhibition will be a great opportunity for the public to enjoy the touches of the master that was not as well-known as he has been elsewhere with 75 sculptures 48 sketches and water-colored paintings.  Among all the works from Musee Bourdelle de Paris the works Daniel Gervis recommended will take you to a journey to the artist's youth and to his very meridian where the artist was greatly influenced by Symbolism and Expressionism and the synthesis of the two ideologies.","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192837_64a5979e81b347f0bdb160e4204cb80e_d558a104bf374756862be5e1ccd39289"

The exhibition &lt;Writing Paintings Painting Words&gt; is intended to look into aspects of employment of words in contemporary art and contemplate on the ways they function and create meanings in works.  As observed in many ancient hieroglyphics the words and images were once &quot;one&quot; thing originally. The two means of communication have the same characteristic ‘the bowls that convey what men want to say’ and they have kept the mutual relationship in which one of them covers the  part that the other one cannot possibly express in full.  In Asian art words and illustrations have naturally coexisted and breathed together in works of many art forms such as poetry writing painting as well as the formative writing calligraphy. In European art the crossing and juxtaposition between words and images can be found easily in many various trends of art such as cubism futurism dadaism and surrealism. The words show up frequently in the contemporary art works that this exhibition consists what would be the reason for that? Perhaps it is because the formativeness and symbolism of words provide the artists with continuous ideas and inspirations and add more meanings to the works for better interpretation.   Through the three themes &lt;Painting Words&gt; &lt;Writing and Painting&gt; and &lt;Writing Paintings&gt; this exhibition will go beyond the stereotypic ideas that words are used only in writings and images are used only in paintings and look into the crossing  between writing language and painting language. By appreciating the works of artists who have built the foundation of unique formative language between writing language and painting language we will be able to rediscover the trends of the contemporary art and travel into joyful world of art through communication with visual and auditory languages the works bring on.","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192837_1470d44823f24e3bb281fdeb99934db7_3187f9d5ecc04c44babc2dec4321f8cb"

Photography has apparently facing the upphase outstanding not only in art market but also in diverse biennale and major exhibitions. This exhibition will provide a chance to look at the landscape of Korean contemporary photography since 1960 through the works of 22 photographers who have been working actively.    Photography was first introduced in 1880 in Korea. However It was difficult for Korean photographers to work professionally as Korea had to go through great hardship such as colonization and war until 1950s. In 1960s Korean photograph faced new aspect through appearance of photographers who observe the society with their own point of view as well as getting out of 'Realism' and 'Amateurism'. Workof photographers who started working at this time is displayed in the first section when photograph department was established setting up photograph theories in Korea.    Korean mainstream photographers' work is exhibited in the second section. When they began to work status of photograph and working environment were improving thanks to economic growth. Liberalization of study abroad also triggered new trend of photograph. They lead innovative exhibitions which continued before and after 1990s showing new possibility with extraordinary work very different from before. They seemed not to be categorized in a particular genre revealing the possibility of new expression. Therefore photograph took root as an important medium for general artists promoting itself to be exhibited in the galleries which were reluctant for photograph.       The final section is for new photographers who just started to present before and after the new century. For the last years photograph magazine was launched  theorists as well as critics appeared exhibition has become vitalized and art market has been apparently booming up. Under this new wave these new faces are very distinguished from Korean traditional photograph in the respect of themes materials and expressions. They express their own critical view about various socio-cultural issues focusing on current life and society rather than Korean traditional beauty.              This exhibition is expected to help the audience understand about Korean contemporary photograph. Furthermore it will support active study of Korean photograph hopefully.","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192837_8c4661afdcaf4cc3b994ba2a5f09c374_25ef1d67e57a49c395a3b22704feba6a"

This exhibition is as if Magrittee speaks to Euclid. It is purposed to give a light on various attitudes of contemporary artists who have rediscovered the values through interaction mutual cooperation and connection based on different areas or cultural differences since the end of 20th century and expanded their areas by the artists’ privilege to intervene with ‘artistic imagination.’ Also ‘Hybridity’ created as a byproduct from the process of collision and connection of various cultures in contemporary age caused by mobility and development of digital network is the background and it focuses on the role of artists who form identity of city space and its neighborhood and transform. This is not the intervention of artists in certain areas or gesture for political changes but it suggests values which have been formed and rediscovered in ordinary relationship. In addition different values are connected and added through artistic intervention and it creates outcomes and synergies out of expectation beyond the expected mathematical calculation.   Likewise it can be a meaningful opportunity to think of its uniqueness further ensuring the cultural identity of ourselves through various attitudes of artists in contemporary age that rediscovered social and political factors through the interaction and mutual relationship among human beings.

In preparing the &lt;2007 Seoul Contemporary Art Exhibition - Engraving&gt; 280 artists engaged in engravings were selected before finally choosing 47 works through the deliberation by the advisory committee members comprising the external experts. Given the exhibition’s purpose aimed at evaluating the value and the potential development of the engraving which tends to be newly evaluated recently in the contemporary art some of the well-known artists were intentionally excluded. Such an attempt is expected to bring us the hope for seeing a more innovative exhibition as well as the possibility of shifting to the exhibition that will meet the need and trend in the year 2007.    The exhibit will give the artists the opportunities of demonstrating the experimental works which will be used as the steppingstone toward the another world not to mention the extensive scope and skills of the engraving. Among the exhibits are variety of contemporary works meeting and corresponding to the tendency of today’s art.

Here nothing can be the center not even human beings but is a system of harmony & unity within the series of creation settlement change and extinction. With the point that nothing can coexist without relationships nature demands a humble attitude from us living in the human-centered modern age. Based on this awakening in relation to nature the short or long one time brush strokes breathe with the scene while the works of art go beyond the artist unfolding as a venue of thought and meditation breathing together with the audience.    - Category : 43 pieces of Paintings Ceramics Photographs etc.  - Participating Artists : Myeong-Ro Yun Gang-So Lee Su-Hwan Oh Cheol-Ju Seok (4 artists)","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=b32.jpg"

He is one of the greatest masters of twentieth century art and had huge influence in various fields such as music film literature and also in the area of popular culture regardless of the East and the West.  Departing from his early work influenced by Cubism and Futurism and influenced by Giorgio de Chirico and Surrealism Magritte formed his own unique style of painting. However unlike Surrealists whose techniques such as automatism yield to almost abstract images Magritte realistically portrayed familiar objects but placed them in incongruent settings or juxtaposed them with contrasting elements. Through this technique called depaysement he focused on visual shock or creating a mysterious atmosphere.   In this exhibition we display his representative work from his entire oeuvre: his 1920’s work that demonstrate Chirico’s and Surrealism’s influences; major works from the 1930’s that demonstrate his depaysement techniques; Impressionist and Vache period work that appeared in the 1940’s; and his work at the end of his life in the 1960’s. Magritte’s photos his short films and other documentations that show his life and art are included in the show as well.

The theme for Seoul International Media Art Biennale which will be held for the fourth time is &quot;Dual Realities.&quot; Artistic Director Wonil Rhee who is one of the most active curators representing the Asian art world and international curators Lev Manovich(USA) Yuko Hasegawa(Japan) Iris Mayr(Austria) and Pi Li(China) are curating for this biennale.  	As the Internet and multimedia become part of our lives the physical world and virtual reality have become closely interrelated in this new era with media environment. Today the discussion on the real world and virtual world is not new and cyberiaculture does not attract much attention any more. Nevertheless the reason for the choice of &quot;duel realities &quot;as a theme of this exhibition is that physical reality and virtual reality are becoming more interchangeable and inseparable. 	&quot;Dual Realities&quot; will approach New Physicality with an artistic language and diverse and creative ideas that will sublimate positive and negative sides and the division of cyberspace to integration and even healing.  	This exhibition will analyze a paradoxical situation where the real world influences virtual reality under the keyword of &quot;Dual Realities&quot; and represent Augmented Reality where the public identity such as SMS messenger Internet community mobile communication expands.

But this exhibition is not directly related to Schwitters. The title is used as one of metaphors and it reflects some of landscapes in Korean contemporary art. It is purposed to look how our dwelling space such as houses and rooms are interpreted in art through installation works objet and images.   Recently the number of artists whose main subject is private space or the thing is increasing. This trend is related to the symptom which converted to microscopic narratives after the collapse of macroscopic discussion.

It is for emerging artists and explores how Korean art will develop in the future.  It looks at the social and cultural issues of our times through the eyes of emerging artists and puts them forward for debate.  The second exhibition is being held in 2006.   Works by young artists are more distinctive than at any other time and discussions on the identity of fine art are incessantly presented amidst the ongoing diversification of art.  The need to look at and discuss the true aspects of society and the culture of our times is continually raised by numerous quarters.  Seoul Museum of Art responded by initiating the SeMA exhibition series which examines the identity of our culture and discusses it by bringing together artists of the young generation who are presenting the cultural issues after having looked squarely at the social and cultural atmosphere of our times and found its salient features.   Like SeMA 2004: Six Stories SeMA 2006 includes six sections under one primary theme of 'Strangers of the City: Jungle Sunshine Asphalt Kid An Anonym Nausea Deviation and Narrative Speaking.    All the six sections presented on SeMA 2006 depict different aspects of the city.  However rather than the superficial form of the city or rosy optimistic future which seems bright and growth oriented the other side of such the city is examined.  The 2006 exhibition shows a kind of humanistic drama attempting to resolve the various emotions we have in the city.  It focuses on the emotions that come to us because we live in the city a place where we must stay because we have no other choice a place we can never escape from.  The emotions of the young - feelingsof insecurity loneliness desire to be deviate to another world or reflection the urban sensitivity children come to have as they inescapably mustlive in a city and other emotions we have in a city like an ad copy &quot;Enjoy it if you cannot escape&quot; are explored.","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192837_631a09159f1a4d339e547f6e6a05cceb_84e8df6516634a308a103c256ef74cb7"

In the modern society which is complicated much and rapid we find ourselves looking for something that we can rely on or transcendental whether it is religion or hobby.   The exhibition of ‘Meditative Forest’ is designed to give an opportunity to the modern people to find the desire for consensus with nature and life one of desires that they have in their heart while living in highly industrialized and mechanized society.    Nature which everything is originated including men is known as having a healing power. Not the nature only emits the chemical sources that we need but it also makes us feel that exhaustion and struggling that we have are nothing compared to life circulation and spaciousness of nature. Unlimited receptiveness of nature which makes us receive simplicity emptiness and everything by provision of nature purifies our heart. Because of this we aspire and seek for nature unceasingly and we are able to find natural elements in art and music which reflect the inner world of artists or musicians.   This exhibition consists of works which make us feel meditative and static representing ‘calmness’ through unique expression of artists on natural beings or expressing superior sublime beauty and awe of nature. This exhibition is to view nature expressed by 11 artists in the form of paintings sculptures photographs and installation art. This is also purposed to let people experience a respite and a beauty of slowness which nature can provide through art especially in hot weather as people feel the healing of both physical body and heart with purification when they step into the forest.

Seoul Museum of Art and advisory committee took great pains to decide whether the scope and concept of figurative sculpture can be established since the distinguishing of genre seems like meaningless as most of art works frequently cross the genre.  For this exhibition the committee and Seoul Museum of Art established the scope and concept approaching ‘figurative sculptures’ from traditional perspective rather than viewing sculptures in extended ways. This is opposite with abstract meaning reconstruction of the object in other words imaginary objects which we can think of their existence in reality are reconstructed or expressed in the way that we can recognize. ‘Figurative’ is opposite with abstract which presents us an optical embodiment of our concepts not recognized.   This exhibition will provide a good opportunity to see various phases of contemporary figurative sculptures of Korea as artists in different age brackets are participated. It is also interesting to see the difference by generations as well as changes of age as spectrum of diverse works can be phased and seen. The artist in 60s and 30s has a generation gap.  Korean art which has changed rapidly in terms of economics and culture is experiencing this and it is revealed in art.

Such paintings are increasingly winning the sympathy of the public these days for their intense concentration strong power of description and extreme sensitivity.   This exhibition includes works by artists of hyper-realistic paintings from the 70s who attempted to dip into and at the same time transcend the figurative paintings of academism and abstract paintings characterized mainly by monochrome those of 'mass art' who used realistic paintings as a mirror reflecting political reality and those of multi-art forms since the 90s who depicted deep insights of objects or expressed their personal feelings through refined composition.   Representation Reconsidered will start the discussion on the nature of form focusing specifically on the much more intense meaning than reproduced images of traditional meaning.  The twenty-four presented artists are so obsessed with objects as to make viewers feel extreme shock and It is through their works that the viewers who are living in the 'era of excessive images' where false desires are daily things and superficial digital images are rampant due to commercial imagery and exaggerated false images of popular culture will have a strong desire to see ‘reality’ as it is or to understand it beyond its exterior in order to reach the essence of reality.","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192837_892eb2061a724a1cbcbd81f5cc161b4b_1487cbf92b5d4451b01ba0c89d5ff589"

Leaving an impressive and tremendous 50000 works over 80 years he imprinted his name upon all the world. So we can say the Art of  the 20th century started with Picasso and moreover considering the flourishing activities of his works it is not too much to say the 20th century is Picasso’s century. This exhibition is planned to introduce the works of genius artist Pablo Picasso through a retrospective exhibition for the first time in Korea.   Generally we can classify Picasso’s works from1895 to 1973 in six periods. The blue period the rose period the cubism period the classical period right after World warⅠ the surrealism period when he painted “Guernica” and the very creative period from World war ll to his latest. This exhibition shows the most important representative works from each period. “La Famille Soler”(1903) in the blue period “Le Pigeon”(1912) in the cubism period “Trois Femmes &agrave; la Fontaine ”(1921) in the classicism period “La Doremeuse au Miroir”(1932) “La Danse”(1927) in the surrealism period and “Femme qui pleure”(1937) in the Guernica period &quot;Le D&eacute;jeuner sur l'Herbe “ in the last period is the most outstanding work of Picasso.  The Main theme of this exhibition is “People of Picasso”. With chronological description various works from the early to the last period show Picasso’s chronological change and changes of style and process. The spectators are able to meet Picasso’s women his family self-portraits figures from history or his imagination and so on in one place.   As we all might know Picasso’s work had always been affected and developed through his many relationships with women. We can’t even know the exact number of women through Picasso’s whole life. But we can see their figures and characters definitely in Picasso’s works.  In this exhibition there will be a separate room displaying Picasso’s women. From Picasso’s first woman Fernande Olivier(1904-1912 in a relationship years with Picasso) to Eva Gouel(1912-1915) and his first wife Olga Kokhlova(1917-1918) Marie-Th&eacute;r&egrave;se Walter(1927-1937) Dora Maar(1936-1943) and Fran&ccedil;oise Gilot(1943-1953) to his second wife and the last woman Jacqueline Roque(1952-1973) all of Picasso’s women will be represented.

As an elder in Korean painting circles and a leading painter Park No-soo has throughout his entire life paved the way to an independent and original Korean style of painting. This donation made in accordance with Park’s aspiration that his works should be passed on the general public includes many state-of-the-art works that show Park’s view of art. The special exhibition covers all Park’s works from 1960 to 2000. It presents both donated pieces and ones purchased by the museum.   His work is often called &quot;a magnificent piece of painting.&quot; The suggestive aftereffect in his works is made from his elastic stroke of the brush and various nuances in his painting expression. That is why his work is praised as &quot;the height of a compromise between the sternness of bukhwa (a trend of painting) and the sentient feeling of namhwa (a trend of painting)&quot; or &quot;a magnificent piece of painting with a concise and intuitive style of stroke. Especially important are broad-minded diagonal composition ellipsis and arrangement of things in the paintings and modernistic beauty of modeling through the use of lucid color. It is impressive because those unique elements of his painting lead audiences to speculate of a perspective beyond things by outgrowing Korea’s typical frame of composition. His painting nevertheless includes an emotional feeling of painting in the literary artist's style called &quot;the unity of poem and painting&quot; which enables Park to make his own independent and original area.   During his early years he developed an original area to show the abstractive expression of figures the bold composition and unique surface painting. Since then he has presented a surface painting with proud loneliness free and easy strokes of the brush and a unique style of painting using blue-hued coloring and swift lines of the brush. Today he achieves his own artistic area and shares it with the public by creating a subjective abstractive painting with clear and beautiful lines transparent colors and free composition.  In this exhibition an animation will be shown to help people understand Park’s works. We send special thanks to Woo Chang-hwan for making to come true an experimental trial to make animation with both intensive modern high technology and the emotional aspects of Korean painting by blending characters and landscapes in Park’s works into a modern media of animation. We hope audiences enjoy a new approach to Korean painting beyond the old thought that painting is traditional.","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192838_c53e2d537b7845688cfb27ebc1ce385f_73eb6b1949154d40bbecc71d6042f32c"

Their works deal with various themes using a lot of media ranging from basic materials such as dyes and Chinese inks to applied materials including daily commodities natural dyestuffs and industrial materials. Nevertheless those works displayed have a point in common in that they request consistency hard work and long time to make.   As all works require us to have persistent inscription on our mind about the meaning of the works complete preparation and a lot of time so did the job to create those works. And they finally make up of a crystallized whole of this exhibition called Resonance-Beyond Repetition. A big picture made by those works however does display physical traces and attributes without showing itself off. Instead as in clear water purifying itself through being leached by other materials those works lead you to a venue of thought and meditation. Following the repetitive scenes of materials you will feel that they fill the space around you and your heart with resonance beyond repetition.   Unlike the modern paintings vaguely decorated with conceptual insignificance and lightness this exhibition offers a venue for us to think about the deep significance that we expect in appreciating artistic works.","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192837_d4790da13c974f3cbf8b094f614cd141_5cbeca37566d4fe2a86e3c363855ff32"

Despite its short life Fauvism played a great role in the color revolution in the 20th century and has remained a very significant art movement.  Lasting only between 1904 and 1908 this short-lived movement is considered a very critical art movement in art history because of its break with the artistic traditions of the past and its important role in the development of the avant-garde in modern art.  This exhibition focuses on the contribution of the Fauves whose work radically pursed a new style against traditional art based on a naturalistic (realistic) manner. It is fascinating to see how modern artistic view has been changed and affected by the fauves. With an intense unmodulated application of pure color and the bold strokes of a loaded brush this colorholic fauves break the traditional conception of naturalistic expression and bring a different artistic viewpoint of new emotional expression.   This exhibition invites you into a beautiful and luminous color adventure through the brilliant works of the leader of the Fauvism; Matisse Derain Dufy Derain Vlaminck and Dongen etc.","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192837_100a22a0f914487aaad16ebcc748ae1e_382501510c4f4b00b2ef362c64a9a422"

Traditional distinctions among different cultural and art genres have long become blurred. The definition of a genre has been extended continuously through countless cultural and ideological experiments. Just as the photography began to claim its own place in art in the early 20th century there has been increasing attempts starting mid 1990 to fuse fashion and art. However most of the exhibitions devoted to this aim have failed to go beyond superficial level with their focus mainly on the visual similarities in the two genres.  In this context “Visions of the Body 2005” which deals with the meaning of body in modern life is hope to further the discussion on how to find common grounds in art and fashion.

The exhibition’s theme the changing concepts of the body is one of the most frequently discussed issues in fashion and art since 1990s and is dealt with in the current show in a broader cultural and historical context. The basic structure of the exhibitions resembles the 1999 “Visions of the Body: Fashion or Invisible Corset” hosted by the National Museum of Modern Art in Kyoto which was acclaimed for its excellent interpretation on the relationship between 20th century fashion and the concepts of the body. The show was also noted for the way it contrasted experimental works of fashion designers and artists and for the projection it made on the future of the relationship between the two genres. Now we are living in the 21st century and it is very likely that the subject the relationship between body and fashion will be further explored. “Visions of the Body 2005” is designed to encourage a more in-depth debate on the issue.

While Korean abstract paintings have established itself as a distinct art-form like monochrome or minimalism through continuous exhibitions here and abroad relatively slight approach to figurative paintings have ever been attempted: not only are they conservative of broaching varied angles after post-70’s hyperrealism and 80’s critical realism they mostly remain in simple schema of landscape still-life and character.  The aims of this exhibition therefore are to explore the possibilities of figurative art largely neglected from Korean art after the 90’s and attempt a more colorful approach to figurative art.Under the overall title of ‘Life Landscape’ the exhibition consists of two smaller themes: ‘Landscape with a Fat Sofa’ and ‘Beyond Landscape.’  The first theme ‘Landscape with a Fat Sofa’ externalizes the ‘Life Landscape’ and its traces of routine human life as symbolized by ‘Fat Sofa’ adopted from Hwang Ji-Woo’s poem of same title &#8211; paradoxically - exposing the inherent tragedy of modern life through a naked compression of the mundane.  If the first theme externalized the traces of the mundane the second ‘Beyond Landscape’ expands into the fundamental human dilemma such as ennui or solitude co-existing under such ‘everyday’ landscapes and blends these psychological footprints into the landscape of life.  Then why Hwang Ji-Woo? Post-90’s figurative arts in Korea even among its various modes are known for their ‘everyday narrative’ of ‘our everyday life landscape and story’; Hwang Ji-Woo is highly acclaimed for his superb poetry suggesting this very private flow of ‘everyday.’    Plays or journals from where the ‘A Diary of a Fat Sofa’ motif was derived or the use of such characters like ‘Mr. Sofa’ in Other fiction for example all attest to its surpassing a simply personal work to gain a symbolic social meaning called ‘the burial under ennui phenomenon’ the metaphor with which to blend the subject ‘Life Landscape’ of this particular exhibition.  ㅇ Exhibited Works: 40 Figurative Paintings ㅇ Participating Artists:  Hwang Young-Ja Yi Heung-Dok Lee Young-Ok Lim Man-Hyuk Son Jin-A Park Young-Kyun Hong Se-Yeon Kwon Hee-Jong Lee Joon-Gu Ryu Young-Joon Kim Dong-Ki Cho He-Seung Kong Song-Hoon Nam Ki-Ho Lim Byung-Kuk Son Young-Gyu","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=104_04151.jpg"

This exhibition provides a rare and special opportunity for visitors to view a wide array of Chagall's works spanning his long career from 1915 to the 1980s.  Recognized as one of the most creative and imaginative artists of the 20th century Marc Chagall was inspired by the fauvists' vivid colors and the cubists' new concept of space. Drawing from these influences he addressed Russian folklores and traditional Jewish themes employing colorful and often whimsical folkloric imagery to create his highly imaginative and very personal style. Chagall has often been admired as a forefather of surrealism due to the surrealistic inventiveness and fantasy of his works. However he was never linked to a particular movement but maintained his own style creating some of the most unique and fantastic imagery.  The exhibition is composed of seven parts that would help to understand his art world; The 1st section: Couple * Lovers the 2nd section: Imagination the 3rd section: Paris the 4th section: Circus the 5th section: Bible the 6th section: Odyssey by Homer the 7th section: Mediterranean World.","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192838_cfa2d5a9d15b41358ddf27c853dc81f0_3369ca2eee82457ea75839622ffdc07b"

However in contemporary art drawings that were once two-dimensional began to occupy a three-dimensional space and space has come to be recognized as a significant element in a work. Furthermore an increasing number of works are considered complete only when presented against the background of the surrounding element of space rather than by themselves.  In these works a line which is the most fundamental element of drawing is drawn in space to form an object. And as conventional  two-dimensional drawing is brought into a space the works present a new concept of space that is non-material and the composition of these lines  highlights their relationship with space all the more. .  空 (Void) refers to a state that exists in itself lacking substance whereas 間 (gap)  refers to a space between one place and another. Thus 空間 (space) refers to an empty place that no object occupies or an abstract concept implying this meaning. Space has emerged as a significant element that completes a work in contemporary art.  Here space is an essential intangible element that forms the composition of a work by maintaining an organic relationship with substance and materials by communicating with them. The focus is now placed on elements that surround a sculpture or installation work that is presented in a three-dimensional space maintaining a close relationship with the space.  The exhibition &lt;Space (空+間)&gt; seeks to explore and reinterpret the meaning of space in contemporary art. It examines the significance of space formed by the gap between lines in a work presented in a three-dimensional world and recognizes the importance of space in works of art.","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192838_9a9828d5b9004f6298e0f333ef3d51a4_58aa0af61554493483c0751b54c8a2ee"

Against this backdrop the &quot;Document&quot; exhibition reflects the very starting point of photography i.e. the photograph as a &quot;document&quot; and objective observation rather than as an art form.  It was in the early 1990s that photography found its place in art museums and galleries. Since then many young artists have been experimenting with a wide array of photographic techniques to explore a broad spectrum of topics and their efforts have played an important role in expanding the concepts and methods of photography.  Recently various art magazines and galleries have run feature articles and curated special exhibitions to diagnose these trends in photography and introduce various discourses.   Meanwhile however the origin of photography as objective observation and documentation of reality is often overshadowed by such romantic projections of photography as art. In this regard this exhibition is designed to revisit the photograph as a document which has been relatively undervalued in Korean photography - how photography reproduces and structures objects and facts reality and history and how this praxis of photography is systematized into &quot;knowledge.&quot;   To that end the exhibition is divided into three themes: &quot;Mr. Gubo goes to an exhibition&quot; &quot;From photography as document to photography as art&quot; and &quot;Attitudes of documentation.&quot;","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20040525.jpg"

As such the exhibition transforms a museum generally considered an institution too aloof  and authoritative to be accessed by the general public into a familiar space where mundane activities such as family outings can take place through the visual arts.    When one thinks of a museum the first image is usually white-walled cubicles or magnificent architecture. This exhibition is designed to change such an attitude through a new exhibit concept: More familiar and public means are used to “go out to find viewers.&quot;     Works of art are no longer inside but in the outdoor spaces of the museum the borders where the museum’s interior and exterior meet. Outside the bounds of the “institution” it is where art and daily life come together.  The exhibition consists of three parts.   Part I is exhibited along the entrance roads to Seoul Museum of Art  the courtyard and the facade of the museum building. Eight artists are participating in Part I including Lee Soon-joo  Bae Young-hwan Kim Shi-ha Seo Jeong-guk + Kim Mi-in Kim Ju-ho Kim Tae-joon Lee Ki-seop and Kim Min-a.  They have installed their works along the entrance roads and courtyard of the museum to change people's awareness through the art medium: public constructions as traffic signs(Lee Soon-joo) stone posts (Bae Young-hwan) and guardrails (Kim Shi-ha). Other seek interactive engagement with viewers through works that combine aesthetics and function such as the art bench(Seo Jeong-guk + Kim Mi-in and Kim Ju-ho).  In addition use of promotional devices such as banners(Lee Ki-seop) and ad-balloons(Kim Jae-joon) also give a new look to the museum breaking away from the conventional image of a museum as a rigid organization.    Part II is an innovative outdoor exhibit created by seven participants including Kim Hyuck Song Pil Lee Ki-il Jeong In-yeop Kang Sun-mi Cha Min-young Lee Jae-kwang + Son Min-young + Choe Jeong-wan. They employ the 'Zorb' a gigantic transparent urethane ball also known as a super ball which has generally been used only indoors. Their work is aimed at changing the concept of outdoor art until now mostly monumental sculpture to shatter the border that defines the inside and outside of a museum while presenting art that is more accessible and people-friendly.    Part III &quot;I am also an artist&quot; program is installed in the museum garden and small garden at the City Hall Annex.  In this hands-on exhibit citizens can take an active part: as producers not merely passive consumers of art.  The exhibit nullifies the stereotypical concept that an exhibit must be inside an institution: It not only presents art in spaces more accessible to viewers but also takes a new approach on how to 'show' or 'view' works of art.","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192837_3883d339490c417f819e22c9ababd2e8_00eecc538fb946a6a3e1d353ad646a8f"

With the help of the French government Seoul Museum of Art has been able to borrow a few of the original works from private collectors in France. Thus this exhibit of 68 original works will give viewers a very precious opportunity to appreciate Pierre & Gilles’ art which has not been seen by the general public.

They identify current issues and create new styles by broaching contemporary culture ahead of the mainstream and reflecting them in their works.    The &quot;SeMA 2004&quot; exhibition being launched this year is designed to showcase promising young artists active in the Korean art scene and to place contemporary society and culture in perspective.    Various galleries and museums in Korea have already established similar programs that annually introduce the works of promising young artists whose original works play an increasingly significant role in Korea's modern art world.  The Seoul Museum of Art's efforts to discover young artists began a little later than other galleries yet it  has distinguished itself among the rest in that it does not merely introduce young artists and their works  but takes it a step further: looking at issues of contemporary art and culture that are reflected in the art.    The young participants of SeMA 2004 develop new artistic  trends through an exploration of contemporary socio-cultural phenomena which are subsequently incorporated into their works through unique perspectives and approaches. SeMA 2004 does more than simply display new artists' work: It presents culture in a contemporary setting so that each artist can explore his/her inner world against the backdrop of rapidly changing contemporary culture. The artists then &quot;read&quot; their works of art in new and innovative ways.    The SeMA 2004 exhibition explores six themes in the contemporary cultural milieu of the young addressing key concepts such as 'digital' 'fast' 'internet' and 'individualism' which represent the culture of the current generation.     The first exhibit &quot;Consumption game-Dinosaur's trick&quot; is a reflection of reality which delves into the issue of hypes in capitalist desires a dominant theme of today’s consumer society where 'fast' culture dominates.    In &quot;Replay-Transplantation&quot; contemporary artists transform traditional materials that were once used to express the humble desires of common people. They force us to look squarely at reality by capturing changes in the &quot;codes&quot; allowing the viewer to read into the works of new interpretations.    &quot;Kidult (Kid + Adult) - Self-portrait of the 21st century&quot; deals with a socio-cultural syndrome that attempts to eradicate boundaries between children and adults in terms of intellect and sensibility.    &quot;Lookism” investigates yet another world we live in more idealized than real amidst the rapid Internet and digital culture. It analyzes Lookism which is fuelled by commercialization greed and the culture of capitalist consumption.    아？？(A-HaeH-HaeH) - Reality's gap&quot; captures the third meaning of ordinary objects and images seen in everyday life which are set in totally different contexts: This reconfiguration shows the anti-cultural characteristics reflected by &quot;the other side&quot; of objects using sharp satire and ironic humor to criticize reality.    Finally in &quot;Playing alone-island dream metamorphosis&quot; the senses grope to discover reality and existence through dreamy images presented in cultural environments of the contemporary world and through new methods of Internet communication.     With these six themes the artists employ subtle wit combined with scathing satire to portray various phenomena in current society symptoms they themselves are experiencing as they read and reinterpret the art from their own perspectives. The works reflect contemporary culture and contemporary perspectives on such cultures as interpreted by the young artists.","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192839_1e044c69718046f79195852e2c453ba8_f541efbec88e4e7d8565084c420348dc"

In addition the exhibition also features dress ornaments furniture metal craftworks to help viewers understand the background of and characters in portraits.  Exceptional advancement in portrait painting in Korea China and Japan is attributable for its respect for ancetors and Confucius tradition of loyalty and filial piety. While portraits in the Western painting were developed for recording and appreciation purposes portraits in these three countries were used for ancestor worshipping ceremonies. As such subjects of portraits were also subject of worshipping such as saints loyal servants and faithful wives and the paintings not only captured realistic features of subjects but expressed characters disposition dignity and other nature of the subject. As a result portrait art of these three countries has reached a unique stage where distinctiveness and idealism of each of these three countries are in exquisite harmony with individual character of each subject. Despite common purpose and objective portrait art of each of these three countries come to have distinctive features from different cultural background.  The exhibition provides a rare opportunity to have a glimpse of artistic and historic value of East Asian portrait pieces and also serves educational purpose to let viewers understand unique Oriental Confucius theory.

In selecting pieces for the collection of abstract art the Museum intends to represent and draw attention to each major trend in contemporary Korean art and to strike a balance between them.","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192838_d3f31bc5aec349f9a54e1d1e5b301e34_98cc7276e58a4de0aa8d988aadc695e3"

The each expression and the spirit shown in the artworks are from the diversity of the formative arts which came from the times they lived in. But it is the sublime art spirit that turns the variety into sympathy.       The exhibition displays various genres of artworks and divide them not simply  chronologically but by figurative and abstractive order. It presents the changes in the traditional world of art and works by theme and trend. Works of Gi-chang Kim Namkwan Eungno Lee Gyungchae Ryu are worth noticing in the exhibition. These works present dramatic changes in order from figurative to abstractive and also let us to track how figurative style and idea of an individual artist get changed by aesthetic consciousness of the times. A work represents self-examination of an individual artist in a time and reflects the spirit of his time.  We expect you to find the meaning of the exhibition in the aspect that the value of art is not only applied in an artist's times but contains some spiritual meaning that has to be descended to posterity.","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114191917_545bac278d31436bb82b78a7a651c48b_940f6cc556b149d2901442bbb84266e4"
"000018","Life : Realism art in 1980's","","SEOUL MUSEUM OF ART","2003-02-11","2003-06-29","","","","","","","","","","The show is arranged to study variously embodied phenomenon of understanding realty and speech of the artists who participated in social and historic situation of that time.  In 1980's participative national art appeared as a movement of self awakening of the time extensively denying modernism which was the main stream of existing artist's world. It would be said that the movement suggested new trend in both conceptional and formal aspects trying to overcome modernism which adhered to elitism captured by the idea of art for art's shake alienating itself from real life. (Seoul Museum of Art names the style like that 'Realism in 80's) The main idea of the realism art in 80's is to recover mutual understanding with the public throughout perceiving reality and returning figure so it was confirmation of life above just personal expression and moreover medium to realize a field of mutual understanding for better life.  Realism art in 80's also showed a phase of cultural movement which widely communicated with the contemporaries in relation with situation of the time. Therefore from the viewpoint of Korean modern art history realism art in 80's has significance on the fact that it is spontaneous art form reflecting our specific historicity. The art works displayed art expression of reality of life. From the works dealt with social historical context to individual life you would see various expression of artists' suffering and understanding of reality. In this point of view this exhibition would be good opportunity for audiences to meditate on true meaning of life.","http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114191917_4ba6ec1d4d40451e8d22ea83ec88b031_3512d6636bb4414b9476438fdd22c304"
